Hello How are you doing today?
Whats up! I'm doing good how are you doing?
Im alright, I just took a nap. But it was one of those naps that doesnt help anything. It just makes everything worse and you question all your life choices
oh wow haha so you still feel tired huh?
Yeah
did you go to bed late?
I have more of a head ache than anything else
dude thats terrible
No, Its just adjusting to a time change But enough about me What are you up to?
im refining my skills on Sketch App have you heard of Sketch?
I havent What is it?
you know what adobe illustrator is right?
Yes
its a vector graphic editor like illustrator but its a lot more light weight and its for UX designers to design UI
Oh nice! What have you been practicing designing
Ive been trying to learn more tools on sketch and just get faster at it] Im doing a free lance job for a professor for his app idea and he needs a mockup of what the app will look like for his pitch
Wow that is cool! When is that all due by?
this weekend haha
Do you think you will finish or is that a pushy deadline?
its a deadline I set haha but I think Ill be able to finish I hope... if not I can push it back a little
Well I wish you the best of luck with that deadline
thanks do you have any personal projects you are working on"?
Not really projects. I finished editing a bunch of engagement pictures. So now all I am really doing is just practicing some sketching I can always practice and improve that skill
oh coooool! was this a paid photoshoot?
Yep, I had a few that I did before I went home for the summer
engagement shoots or weddings are goooood money but i hear in utah its super competitive
Yeah there are so many, every other person takes pictures Its easy to do it for friends and people you know but past that it is hard to get more business
yeah true do you think if you wanted to pursue your photography you wuold have to move out of utah?
Um maybe, People need pictures everywhere But I dont really want to do that, its fine for the side, but too hard to make a living on Remind me what you want to do career wise?
I want to become a UX desiner if you werent Christian what religion would you be in if at all?
Hm Maybe Buddhist What about you? I think its a really peaceful practice and it would match my personality
I probably would be buddhist culturally because IM korean but if i had a choice I wouldn't label myself as any religion egnostic? is that the term?
I think that is a term but I dont know exactly what it means Thats really cool
I need to go. Thanks for chatting!

Hello
My life is confusing

hello???
hi can you see my chats now?
yep
yeah no one is on... probably because today is the last day yeah you are probably right. A lot of them probably stopped because they know where they are going to end up
man I feel like we have talked about just about everything that we could tell each other
yeah... I am exhausted now
well what would you do if you had a flying car?
hahahaha these prompts are actually kind of nice to answer ummm I probably would I dont know... travel the world travel the world or if its possible I would turn it in to a time machine so that I can travel in time. Like back to the future but with flying cars
nice that would be cool I think time travel would be so cool would you change your past if you could?
by time travelin? like what part of my past?
anything
I dont know to be honest. I really like the person that I am now and I don't want to change anything about it
interesting
well i just appreciate all the choices that I've made. good and the bad ones because they have taught me lessons that I will not have learned if I went back and changed my past but then again if I could go back in time to invest in some stocks that I know would have been successful now, I would totally go back in time and do that but as far as like my choices goes I dont really care. I like who I am
wow that is deep
thanks
i really admire that I think embracing who we are is what helps us move on from the hard things in life and grow
yes if you can't embrace who you are then you will be stuck in loop that you can't get out of and it will be hard to learn anything for yourself because you are just going to 'blame your weaknesses or something
that is truth right there
yeah I know a lot of people who don't really know who they are and or will not embrace who they are and are envious of other people who have a better life or personality or whatever and it brings them down and they just are depressed and ungrateful people i've been around too many of those kinds of people to know that embracing who you truly are is the path to freedom and progression
I have a couple people who are close to me are like that one of them actually snapped out of it kind of and is trying to graduate from college but my other friend is still doing drugs and is partying and does not want to progress with life because he doesn't know what he wants in life and or he just won't work for it
yeah its really sad to see your close friends that choose a path like that because they will lag behind our progression in life and we will move on to better things but they will just be stuck at where they are and wont move but they will still be my friends nonetheless
yeah for sure. if my friend who is still making bad choices hits me up then I will definitely go see him I probably should reach out to him honestly and ask him to hangout with us
yeah you should if you as a close friend dont reach out to him then no one else will and he will keep falling while you move away from him so you probably should hit him up soon
yeah I will thanks for that
you are welcome
what about you?
what about me?
do you have any friends that you wish you still had kept in touch or reached out to?
yes I do
what happened to them?
well I wanted to reached out to them but they were just too far gone and they had other friends. I wish I could have done something but looking back I dont think I could have done much
oh why do you feel that way?
I feel that way because at the beginning stages of my friends bad choices I could not stop them because they didnt feel like they were doing anything bad or they didnt think they would end up where they are at now I did try to tell them to stop and change and things like that but they refused to listen and now I am sure that they have looked back and probably felt that they should have not made bad choices in the first place but I bet they feel that its too late now to turn back to who they were
yeah i hate that but they is Satan's biggest lie "you can't turn back and go back to who you were before"
yeah so true
its too bad for your friends. i feel bad for them. I hope they make it out or turn back
me too.

hello!
Hello! How are you?
doing well! how about yourself?
I'm doing awesome! Big plans for today?
nope! just work and relaxing ahah
Where do you work?
although I have big plans on cooking up some ribs tonight so that's pretty exciting probably gonna be the highlight of my day! I work an oncampus job What about you? Any big plans?
Oh wow that is highly exciting, you are eating good food! Nice, what do you do? No big plans, just working on some stuff for work!
LOL security YEAH i haven't had ribs in SO long so it's overdue where do you work?
Where do you do security?

My best friend doesn't know that I have been to 43 states.
My best friend knows legit everything about me Which states haven't you been to?
Hahahaha! I haven't been to Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.:)
That's legit
Yeah. Are you going to the football game tonight?
Probably not, I've been working since 4:30 so I'll likely be dead haha Are you?
Oh my gosh wow. Yeah, I am. Where do you work?
I do security So mostly I just watch cameras

what is true AI?
I think true AI would be when computers were capable of programming themselves.
oh interesting havent'heard that answer before
It's pretty scary to think about. Hopefully computers don't get to that point!
yeah it will become the matrix
But it would also be an incredible acheivement
if that happens
Whew. Thankfully I don't think we are anywhere close..
I think it will be true AI if we can't distinguish them from a Robot to another person
In what kind of situation? Like caring for another human, or being able to have a conversation?
in any situation
I can definitely see that.
what are you studying makenna?
Right now, I'm just taking some STAC classes thank goodness! What about you?
nice! Im studying Information Technology
Cool cool! I've heard that's a pretty tough major.
yeah the winter sememster was a tough one but i got through it!
Is that in the business school or is IS in the business school?
IS is
And congrats! I'm glad you survived haha.
thanks haha
So what's the best class you have ever taken at BYU?
hmmm my UX Design Team class my professor and I started it last semester and it was a blast because we got to work with real companies and do UX work for them
Oh that's awesome!! Did you work in big groups or individually?
iin groups and we switched around
I wish there was something like that in my major. It would be great!
whats your major?
Exercise science!
oh cool1 why are you in that major?
I love science! It's amazing. And learning about the human body and how everything interacts just makes me feel like I understand what's going on. You know?
yeah i feel you do you want to become a nurse?
Oh definitely not. I will be going on to do a PhD in immunology.

Hello
Hey how are you?
I am doing well, its good to meet up again
Yeah I just got home It's been a rough day
Oh no, what happened?
Ugh I drove for 3 hours
That can be a long drive Did you have any good music playing?
Yeah. I played the greatest showman and then I just played my general playlist
I used to not like driving and think that anything took forever. But then After highschool I started driving more and more, almost all day every day. Now driving isnt too bad. Things go by a lot quicker And the greatest showman soundtrack helps a ton
Yeah. My legs always get tired when I drive. I don't know why. After a while my leg muscles start to burn
Hm thats interesting, do you use cruise control? Or do you keep your foot on the gas the whole time?
Cruise control
Nice, then I have no clue. But I guess sometimes pushing the pedal helps me not just cramp up I dont know
Yeah. Me neither it sucks. Also I still don't have my test scores. The suspense is killing me
I am waiting on two more exam scores as well. I dont like waiting It is pretty suspenseful
Yeah. I am waiting on two as well.
The worst is when you forget about it, and you are having a good time. And then you get your score back and its not a good one
I have As in all my other classes and I am happy about that so I should forget the last two and be patient. Oh yeah that is the worst.
It caught me off guard, and usually I am pretty patient and understanding. I dont know why it made me so upset that time I guess just because I wasnt expecting it
I would be disappointed if I got a bad score on either one.
Im sure you did well if you have "A's" in everything else I have been trying to finish all of my food before moving out and I had all this cream cheese left and I found out that cream cheese goes well with chicken and potatoes
Hmmm Are you there?
Are you not getting my messages? I am still here
No I am now What did you say?
what is the last thing that you got?
The one that said I guess I just wasn't expecting it
Oh I just said I am sure you did well if you have A's in your other classes
Did you say anything else?
Nothing else important, just that I was trying an interesting combination of food, cream cheese and chicken
Ohhhhh that is weird I can't believe I didn't get it.
Its actually pretty good Did nothing show up at all?
What is No
Hm, weird The chicken and cream cheese is what I was saying is pretty good
I can see what you are saying now though. Whthay doesn't make sense I didn't get the context.
Nevermind, it doesnt matter What are your plans now that you are home again?
Just hang out with my family.
Oh right, that will be so much fun Does your family play board games or anything together?
It will be. They will be at school during the day though
Like what do you like to do with them?
Yeah we do. How about yours? We play videogames Drive places and do hikes Just whatever How about you what do you do with your family?
That sounds like so much fun to do those things together! With my family we like to go try new food, play card games, go out on the boat, or go on walks
That's always fun. We used to go on walks when I was younger. Now that we live out in the middle of nowhere it is way different Do you ever do family reunions? Those are interesting.
Haha I am sure, I mean where would you walk to? One side of the family does, I have never been before. But this June I will be going to my first one!
We would walk around the block. Along the way we would pass members of our ward. We took our dog along with us as well and it was a privilege to be the one who got to hold the Leash
Haha how often were you the one who was able to hold the leash? And what kind of dog?
Wow hope you enjoy it. Family reunions are weird for me because it is usually a bunch of people I don't know It is a Maltese poodle. Right now she is like 13 years old I think. Don't quote me on that. Oh I almost always held the leash I was the dogs favorite
Nice! I am excited, I am sure I wont know most people but it will be good time spent with the ones I do
After I left on my mission she forgot me and now she has another favorite
did you feed the dog? Is that why you were her favorite
Yeah that is true. No I just spent a lot of time with her And I would rub her back Sounds like a key formula If only that worked for girlfriends
Hahaha that is funny If only it were that easy
Yeah, it isn't though.
Do you have any crazy dating stories?
I have a few, but I need to go to bed. We can talk about them more next time. It was nice chatting with you! Good night!

Hello?
Hello:)
So what would you do with a flying car?
I would fly over seas to visit other continents What about you?

No, computers cannot fall in love
I wouldnt think so either How is your night going?
It's going pretty good. I'm just spending time at home with my family
Oh thats nice!
What about you?
I just finished up work and taking a little break I have been indexing documents all day
Cool! What kind of work do you do?
I work for my Dad for marketing and all the office work for his business Right now it is organizing all the previous leads the company has had
Nice, I had a similar job last year. I had an internship at a nuclear powerplant and was the administraative assistant. dealing with papers was a large segment of my day Do you like office work?
Oh that sounds like it would still be interesting, what did you do the other half of the day? I like organizing, Ill be more excited to do the social media work and logo design
I organized and ran meetings and sometimes helped the graphics department design banners and posers. It just kind of depended on the week
That sounds sweet
You're interested in graphic design?! That's so cool!
Yeah I really like a lot of art
Me too! I actually plan on going into illustration. What type of art do you like?
Sweet! I do photography, drawing, graphic design, painting Really anything I can get my hands on
I mostly do digital art. I love doing fan art and comissions for people. Bringning other peoples' characters to life is super fun Do you have a favorite artist?
Oh that is cool! What kinds of stuff have you done I really like James Kirk Richards and Rose Datoc Doll
I have had an author reach out to me to design her characters which was super fun. My dream job is to illustrate for books so it was a great opportunity Then I just do random people's requests. My favorite one so far has been this one character that has ight powers and is from a steam punk society. light
That is really cool that you have had the opportunity to do all of that How do you figure out what the person wants in the art
Also, my favorite artists are Gabriel Picolo and Charlie Bowater I have then email or DM me the description of their characters and an idea of what they want the picture to look like And then I send them updates throughout the process to make sure I'm doing what they want
I just looked up those artists they have really cool stuff That seems like a good way to make sure they are happy I do that with pictures I take, I send a few to make sure they like the edits
Your artists have amazing work as weel! They both have such interesting styles Do you photograph at events?
I really love how unique their styles are Yeah I do weddings, engagements, family, all sorts of stuff
Thats awesome! I imagine wedding photos would be my favorite if I were a photographer. Do you have a preference?
I just like one on one portraits It is the least stress and the easiest to manage Weddings are great and beautiful, but they take so much work And trying to manage so many people it can be really stressful
I bet haha, so many guests and pressure.
Yeah and they all want you to do different things for pictures
What is the best picture you have ever taken True, plus its probabaly hard to round everyone up for big group pictures, especially if they have a big family with lots of little kids
Kids are great But so many kids You just cant get them all to look Um I dont know what it would be I have different favorites and they change
Same here, I dont think I could pick a favorite drawing. I would end up showing anyone who asked at least ten peices
Hahah yeah Let me just whip out this slide show real quick
seriously though haha. We could be there for hours and then the other person would get bored and would awkwardly have to find an excuse to leave lol
Hahaha yeah
I'm also a huge book nerd and a lot of my stuff is fan art so I'd probabaly end up spoilng an entire book for the poor guy
Hahaha What is your favorite book?
uhhhhhh this is like the favorite picture question haha
Haha well what is a good one you have read most recently
I like everything by ySarah J. Maas, the selection sereis, Shatter me series
Hm I have never heard of her
Her books are so good!! The new one just came out this week and im painfully waiting for my library to get it haha. What about you? Do you like reading?
I like reading when I take the Time to do that
[Also, Sarah J. Maas didnt write the series I listed after that. those are just other books I like] Have you read anything by Brandon Sanderson?
I havent I feel silly saying I like to read and I dont know any of the authors
It's all good haha. What type of books do you read
I am reading my favorite books from growing up again They are the Guardian of gahoole series
Are those the cat worrior books? NO WAIT those are the owl books!! I've totally read those
Haha yeah I love owls So it was my favorite And its fun to read it again, I dont remember a lot of these
Did you see the movie they made of those books?
I did! I love it It took a lot out, but it is still about owls and way cool
yeah, they did a pretty good job on that movie I'm always so worried when books i like are being made into movies
Yeah it can be tricky and kinda risky I was hoping they would make another I care for when they leave a dramatic ending that totally could be a a follow up movie
Yeah, they did that with the fallen series movie. left everyone on a complete cliff hanger and then canceled the second movie
I WOULD BE SO MAD
I KNOW RIGHT!! I'm still very disapointed
I cant stand watching TV shows that do "to be continued" either I refuse
Same haha, but sometimes I get into a show and then it evolves into one and then I'm trapped
AND THAT IS THE WORST You love and hate it
Yup.i also hate it hwen you get into a show only to find out the next season is coming out in a year
Yes That is of the devil I know there are a ton of shows that I would get into But I wont let myself watch them And then eventually I can just binge them
Ugh, im actualy waiting for the next season of Victoria to come out.... in september 2019: [I am too weak to resist haha. The torute seems woth it at the time, until you finish the existing seasons and then its just insanity
Hahaha I am sorry for your loss
RIP
Ill write a eulogy
Thank you, i would do the same for you, but youre too smart to get trapped in the cruel games of tv shows
You would think, but sometimes I am weak Like for Brooklyn 99
I LOVE THAT SHOW
Oh me too
It's so funny haha. Who is your favorite character? I love Gina and Captain Holt And jake, and Charles, and basically all of them
Gina is my spirit animal I love her And Rosa
Yassss and Jake+Amie the best Amy*
Haha they are cute Are you caught up?
Not all the way. I am in the current season though. wbu?
I just watched the most recent one yesterday
Do you watch it on hulu?
I do
Me to, I share the acount with a bunch of family though so sometimes i cant watch it because other people are already logged in
Oh that isnt fun
but its free this way so....-\ [**]
Oh I pay for mine and other people mooch off me
^My atempt at the shrugging shoulders emoji haha I am the moocher in this case haha
Haha I can appreciate that I just figure my sister buys me a lot of food, so it works out And she and her husband take me to movies occasionally
I am a movie theatre adict haha. I have the movie pass that lets you watch one movie a day for just $10 a month
I have heard about those!
I dont go every day but its super nice when I'm bored
Do you like it? Thats good
I LOVE IT!!! like, i can go to the super nice theatre with the reclining chairs which usually costs $13 a ticket as much as i want for just $10 a month. its crazy
I would probably do that If there was a good line up of movies coming out And if I had a way to get to the theater But I dont have time or a ride so right now it wouldnt be worth it
yeah, that is definatley a problem haha. I wont have a car at school so im enjoying it while it lasts
Nice! Live it up What movies are you excited for
Infinity wars was awesome, and overboard was hillariou, there is this one movie coming out soon called adrift that im really excited for It has the girl from the "fault in our stars" and the guy that plays fynnik in "the Hunger Games" in it.
OH I SAW THE PREVIEWS I want to see that
and incredibles 2
yes yes yes
SAME!!! And its a true story so thats super crazy And only been waitng AN ENTIRE DECADE for incredibles 2 im so pumped
Oh me too I love the previews Have you seen the one with Frozones wife Well she speaks but they didnt show her
yes haha. She is iconic
I would have been so mad if they didnt include her I am also excited for the next fantastic beasts
Oh yeah! I forgot about that one. it has Ezra Miller in it right?
Uh... I dont really know names
the one guy from justice leage that played the flash?
I havent seen that yet Is it good?
It was pretty good. I really liked the cast I'm kinda a marvel person though so I can't say I Loved it without being a traitor;)
Haha I like marvel better too
Whats your favorite marvel movie?
I like doctor strange or spiderman home coming
spiderman homecoming is definately one of my favorites. I'm low key in love with tom holland [the guy that plays spiderman]
I know his name He is awesome Haha
just making sure haha. that is definately a name worth knowing. have you seen black panther yet
I have:) THat is a good one also I love zendaya too
Me too! She is so awesome! Her ar tin greatest showman was awesome! and her outfit at the met gala was amazing
I follow her on instagram and sometimes I foget she is famous and I am like oh yeah how is my friend zendaya doing
haha thats awesome! I feel like she would be the coolest friend ever.
Can you imagine having a friend like her and tom Ugh I want a celebrity friend
I imagine it all the time..... it would be magical haha
It really would
and ned from homecoming would be awesome to. Like, i just want to join the friendgroup that they are in in the movie and then my life would basically be comlete [Sorry, I've let my syntax go haha. My spelling and capitalization are all over the place]
haha no worries I want more spiderman movies with tom
same, i need them
I need all of them One day I will meet them
same, a lot of the marvel guys are going to be at comicon in seattle the end of june and to get a vip to meet all of them is over $1,000 but,
Oh my goodness It would be worth it if I got a friend out of it
the Tom VIP which includes an meet and greet and a picture with tom with some other stuff costs $500...
Id pay 1000 for a friend like tom WORTH IT
same man, same theoretically, i could make it... but i would probably lose my job and i would also be taking like $1000 out of my college savings maybe next year haha
Yeah... That is a lot in terms of college expenses its like one solid book
true hahahaha i mean.... if tom halland fell in love with me and we got maried... would i really need a college fund at all?
Probably not Do you think if you messaged them through instagram they would ever see it?
maybe, ive considered doing that but what would you say that would catch their attention enough to reply?
I dont even know I would want to draw them something Impress them with my art
would you want to give off the "im here to be your friend, not because your a celebrity and im not like other girls" vibe or would you go for the " please speak to me, ILY" aproach?
Hahahaha A little of both I am sure they have heard it all I doubt they would even open the messages they get
same, art is the way to the heart
Maybe they would for fun sometime and see it But dont they have millions of followers
i think youre on to something with the art aproach. just made a super bomb art peice and post it and tag tom in it and then he woud see it and be like "dang i must talk to this person"
more like " I must friend this person" Then he would ask to hang out
Yeah, they do have millions of followers but i have seen people do the art thing and tom will follow them for it YES!!
NO FLIPPING WAY I am totally making art of tom and zendaya
and then you would go on the coolest date ever and get his number and next thig yo know youre going to the red carpets together do it! i support this plan
Haha well for me Tom and I could be friends, I dont think He runs that way Maybe the coolest date with zendaya She rocks the red carpet events though, I dont know how I could even stand near her there
hahah sorry, i was going to ask if you were a guy or a girl but i didnt know if we were supposed to with the rules haha this works out great then, i have tom all for myslef and you have zendaya. the is an even better plan
Haha no worries We can be like celebrity couple friends It will work out great We both do the art for them And they keep being amazing
YAS and we can all thank the BYU chit chat for it. what a great story that would be haha
Hahaha I really want this to happen
yup, plus well probabaly become famous artists becasue everyone will ewant the art that got tom and zendayas attention me too, my hopes are getting too high
Yeah I will be thoroughly disappointed Do you think Zendaya will end up being like the new lady gaga
I wouldt say lady gaga, but i think she is going to be pretty huge as far a celebrities go. I thik shes to down to earth to be gaga
Yeah I was just thinking that she does a lot of wigs and crazy awesome outfits did you see her most recently? with the medevial one
her joan of arc outfit was pretty sweet though
I think she is more down to earth too Yeah! that one is so awesome
Yes!! it is so cool and ive literally seen so much fan art of it already. its crazy instagram is an amazing place
there has been a lot? Dang I am behind Maybe what you need to do is draw what she should wear next
theres been a good amount. at least in my little relm of artists i follow theres an idea.... what woud you draw
I dont even know
me either... i cant even decide if i would go with a dress or a casual outfit or a high fashion look like the ones her brother designs
Maybe something like a roman or greece look But with a little extra flair
That would be cool
What would you do?
or like a steampunk look
Yeah!
ugh i wish were were allowed to know eachother haha
Maybe at the end! Two people I have talked to have figured out who I am haha
but along with this zendaya, would we throw tom in the picture as well
They just gleaned enough information from conversation to do it Probably
interseting...
They go well together
yeah... but just as friends;)
Oh for sure
they arent allowed to be with eachother haha
they would be a terrible couple I called dibs first tom
yeah, not only is he mine and her yours, but zendaya also has a good three inches on him
How tall is she
like 5'10 maybe?
Okay so she couldnt wear heels with me
yup its 5'10
Otherwise I would need some extra boost in my shoes
are you 5'10?
Im like 5 11
also, i couldnt wear heels with tom and im fine with that you and zendaya will still work he is one ince taller than me
Nice! See this is all working out so nicely
ikr! now we jsut gotta make that fan art and get this thing rolling
What day should we schedule the weddings should they be like around the same time? Or like? hahah I guess that is jumping a few steps
hmmmm maybe like march of next year?? then we have time to meet them, seal the deal, and then time to work off the holiday chub
Perfect
plus march has good weather
I see now flaw no*
idk how ill handel the paparazi though...they will be all over the story of two commoners falling in love with two super awesom celebs
It will be horrific to deal with the paparazi
^once again sorry about the typos, ive stopped proof reading messages before i send them haha
No worries I type too fast and do the same I get a little lazy
same, plus im not using my phone so it doesnt auto correct for me first world problems haha
Seriously
i think the first story the paparazi would have on me is " tom hollands girl caught cleaning out baker... what a beast" bakery*
hahahahahaha im dead oh my goodness
thye would have pics of me savagely eating fistfulls of pastries and there would be an action shot of me chucking a mangles brownie at the lense mangled*
Hahahahaha then tom in the background with you
carrying the rest of my boxes with look of amusement and admiration on his face probably handing me my next "weapon"
Hahaha Then Zendaya and I would be in the self serve Ice cream place just pouring it all into our mouths directly
yessss hahaha or you would be the people that bring the giant popcorn tubs and fill them with soft serve haha
Oh yes And then wear all sorts of wigs WE COULD HAVE COUPLE WIGS AND THEMED OUTFITS
heck yeah!! and fake mustaches to desguise yourselves
Hahaha
your fan art should just be a pic of you and zendaya wearing coordinating outfits. that would be a great conversation starter
I want this all to happen so bad
same... it seems weirdly possible hey do any of your favorite artists have instagrams
Mine is glitching way bad I dont know if you can see any of this

no not at all we do it all the time and we turn them back on anyway
I feel like turning it off is actually good once in a while, if a computer isn't working correctly we turn them off and turn them back on anyway to fix them
yeah that is the fix all when you dont know what to do i hate it when it gets that bad
Yeah, or when the WiFi isn't working so you have to get up from whatever you're doing and go unplug it, does that ever happen to you? That happens all the time to me
yeah luckily at byu that never happens i sweaR they have google fiber or something the internet is always absolutely great
Yeah that sounds about right
have you been there?
Where?
to byu
Yeah I'm a student there
oh sweet a lot of the people i have talked to today are incoming freshmen
Oh cool, I'm a junior so now I feel old so that's great
but i guess you arent one of them haha oh wow you are old so you are going to be graduating pretty soon! what are you majoring in again?
Haha well I didn't think I was old until now! Neuroscience, we'llsee if I'm actually able to graduate next year
oh sweet i considered doing neuroscience how do you like it? I know a pair of twins in the program they are from my home town
Nice, it's difficult but a lot of fun. I've really loved it. So you're an incoming freshman too?
no heavens no do i look like an incoming freshmen to you?
Haha well how am I supposed to know? I thought I would only be old to a freshman
hahaha well you are old unless i am a senior which i am not i am a sophomore by the way
I kinda figured. And to be fair I'm technically the age of a sophomore because I graduated high school with my associates So I'm not old thank you very much

Hello!
That would be super cool if we had faster than light space travel But it would make things really interesting if it malfunctioned in anyway
It would be cool but I think it would be a bad call for humans to have that capability!
You would be millions of miles away from the desired location Why would it be a bad call?
Based on past experience humans would use it poorly Not based on past personal experience! I mean based on how humans have behaved in the past I think it would be a bad call But there would be lots of interesting adventures if it did malfunction I'm sure
Can you imagine the expense to the speed of light line [like an airline company I guess]
Ridiculously expensive I'm sure!
It would be terrible if you went too far by a fraction of a second and have to make up the cost to the people crazy enough to ride at the speed of light
But I still stand by my belief that it would be really bad for humans to have access to that power So many things could go wrong!
Also, if an asteroid or some floating object goes into tour path you are done for. So that wouldn't be very fun... Everyone would die. But the question is...would you feel anything? Probably not, it's gojng so fast Going
That's true...but isn't there a way to program your ship to avoid that? I'm drawing on Star Wars knowledge here not actual scientific knowledge
Probably but you would have to have a very precise instrument
You're probably right...I guess if we did have faster-than-light travel it would start out very primitive with lots of mishapscollisions then eventually more refined ways
Right
of doing things would be developed and people would be successfully able to navigate around stuff while traveling at the speed of light
It's a work in progress Bad in the end it would be really cool And in theory it's really cool But in the end
It would be more convenient for interstellar travel
My spelling is terrible today
It's okay!
We could go visit other planets! That would be cool!
But I think it would be a bad thing for humans to posses Someone would misuse it
And find out if there are aliens!
Do you think there are aliens?
And we could go visit a planet and get back before dinner time I don't deny that there may be aliens
Exactly! It would be commercialized into weekend excursion *excursions
But I can't confirm it either
Interesting, and why do you think that?
That would make cruises in the Bahamas look cheap!
Ha yeah! Maybe cruises would be cheaper
That would be the best I could convince all my friends to go to space and I enjoy cheaper criuses And that would bring a whole new meaning to "airline food" They would seriously have to pressure those cabins so the food doesn't get all over you. Too bad to that fellow who enjoys a nice hot beverage! And the fellow behind him haha
No kidding! There would be so many problems they'd have to fix But people are really inventitive so I'm sure it could be done
It would be way too complicated I'm sure they could figure it out
Not me haha someone else who is way smarter than me
Yeah, same That's a topic I'm not willing to touch
It makes me actually physically sick to think about the amount of math and science knowledge, time, and effort that would have to go into figuring that out
It would take multiple lifetimes I think Or at least a team of people that is way too big to imagine
It's probably something they've been working on for the past 50 or 60 years so eventually they'll figure it out
Yeah. Especially with all the technological advances they have continuously I've got to go but have a wonderful day!
