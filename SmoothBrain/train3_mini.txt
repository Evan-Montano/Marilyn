What is your name
My name is Marilyn.
What's your name??
I'm Marilyn! What's yours?
Hello How are you doing today?
Whats up! I'm doing good how are you doing?
Im alright, I just took a nap. But it was one of those naps that doesnt help anything. It just makes everything worse and you question all your life choices
oh wow haha so you still feel tired huh?
Yeah
did you go to bed late?
I have more of a head ache than anything else
dude thats terrible
No, Its just adjusting to a time change But enough about me What are you up to?
im refining my skills on Sketch App have you heard of Sketch?
I havent What is it?
you know what adobe illustrator is right?
Yes
its a vector graphic editor like illustrator but its a lot more light weight and its for UX designers to design UI
Oh nice! What have you been practicing designing
Ive been trying to learn more tools on sketch and just get faster at it] Im doing a free lance job for a professor for his app idea and he needs a mockup of what the app will look like for his pitch
Wow that is cool! When is that all due by?
this weekend haha
Do you think you will finish or is that a pushy deadline?
its a deadline I set haha but I think Ill be able to finish I hope... if not I can push it back a little
Well I wish you the best of luck with that deadline
thanks do you have any personal projects you are working on"?
Not really projects. I finished editing a bunch of engagement pictures. So now all I am really doing is just practicing some sketching I can always practice and improve that skill
oh coooool! was this a paid photoshoot?
Yep, I had a few that I did before I went home for the summer
engagement shoots or weddings are goooood money but i hear in utah its super competitive
Yeah there are so many, every other person takes pictures Its easy to do it for friends and people you know but past that it is hard to get more business
yeah true do you think if you wanted to pursue your photography you wuold have to move out of utah?
Um maybe, People need pictures everywhere But I dont really want to do that, its fine for the side, but too hard to make a living on Remind me what you want to do career wise?
I want to become a UX desiner if you werent Christian what religion would you be in if at all?
Hm Maybe Buddhist What about you? I think its a really peaceful practice and it would match my personality
I probably would be buddhist culturally because IM korean but if i had a choice I wouldn't label myself as any religion egnostic? is that the term?
I think that is a term but I dont know exactly what it means Thats really cool
I need to go. Thanks for chatting!

Hello
My life is confusing

hello???
hi can you see my chats now?
yep
yeah no one is on... probably because today is the last day yeah you are probably right. A lot of them probably stopped because they know where they are going to end up
man I feel like we have talked about just about everything that we could tell each other
yeah... I am exhausted now
well what would you do if you had a flying car?
hahahaha these prompts are actually kind of nice to answer ummm I probably would I dont know... travel the world travel the world or if its possible I would turn it in to a time machine so that I can travel in time. Like back to the future but with flying cars
nice that would be cool I think time travel would be so cool would you change your past if you could?
by time travelin? like what part of my past?
anything
I dont know to be honest. I really like the person that I am now and I don't want to change anything about it
interesting
well i just appreciate all the choices that I've made. good and the bad ones because they have taught me lessons that I will not have learned if I went back and changed my past but then again if I could go back in time to invest in some stocks that I know would have been successful now, I would totally go back in time and do that but as far as like my choices goes I dont really care. I like who I am
wow that is deep
thanks
i really admire that I think embracing who we are is what helps us move on from the hard things in life and grow
yes if you can't embrace who you are then you will be stuck in loop that you can't get out of and it will be hard to learn anything for yourself because you are just going to 'blame your weaknesses or something
that is truth right there
yeah I know a lot of people who don't really know who they are and or will not embrace who they are and are envious of other people who have a better life or personality or whatever and it brings them down and they just are depressed and ungrateful people i've been around too many of those kinds of people to know that embracing who you truly are is the path to freedom and progression
I have a couple people who are close to me are like that one of them actually snapped out of it kind of and is trying to graduate from college but my other friend is still doing drugs and is partying and does not want to progress with life because he doesn't know what he wants in life and or he just won't work for it
yeah its really sad to see your close friends that choose a path like that because they will lag behind our progression in life and we will move on to better things but they will just be stuck at where they are and wont move but they will still be my friends nonetheless
yeah for sure. if my friend who is still making bad choices hits me up then I will definitely go see him I probably should reach out to him honestly and ask him to hangout with us
yeah you should if you as a close friend dont reach out to him then no one else will and he will keep falling while you move away from him so you probably should hit him up soon
yeah I will thanks for that
you are welcome
what about you?
what about me?
do you have any friends that you wish you still had kept in touch or reached out to?
yes I do
what happened to them?
well I wanted to reached out to them but they were just too far gone and they had other friends. I wish I could have done something but looking back I dont think I could have done much
oh why do you feel that way?
I feel that way because at the beginning stages of my friends bad choices I could not stop them because they didnt feel like they were doing anything bad or they didnt think they would end up where they are at now I did try to tell them to stop and change and things like that but they refused to listen and now I am sure that they have looked back and probably felt that they should have not made bad choices in the first place but I bet they feel that its too late now to turn back to who they were
yeah i hate that but they is Satan's biggest lie "you can't turn back and go back to who you were before"
yeah so true
its too bad for your friends. i feel bad for them. I hope they make it out or turn back
me too.

hello!
Hello! How are you?
doing well! how about yourself?
I'm doing awesome! Big plans for today?
nope! just work and relaxing ahah
Where do you work?
although I have big plans on cooking up some ribs tonight so that's pretty exciting probably gonna be the highlight of my day! I work an oncampus job What about you? Any big plans?
Oh wow that is highly exciting, you are eating good food! Nice, what do you do? No big plans, just working on some stuff for work!
LOL security YEAH i haven't had ribs in SO long so it's overdue where do you work?
Where do you do security?

My best friend doesn't know that I have been to 43 states.
My best friend knows legit everything about me Which states haven't you been to?
Hahahaha! I haven't been to Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin.:)
That's legit
Yeah. Are you going to the football game tonight?
Probably not, I've been working since 4:30 so I'll likely be dead haha Are you?
Oh my gosh wow. Yeah, I am. Where do you work?
I do security So mostly I just watch cameras

what is true AI?
I think true AI would be when computers were capable of programming themselves.
oh interesting havent'heard that answer before
It's pretty scary to think about. Hopefully computers don't get to that point!
yeah it will become the matrix
But it would also be an incredible acheivement
if that happens
Whew. Thankfully I don't think we are anywhere close..
I think it will be true AI if we can't distinguish them from a Robot to another person
In what kind of situation? Like caring for another human, or being able to have a conversation?
in any situation
I can definitely see that.
what are you studying makenna?
Right now, I'm just taking some STAC classes thank goodness! What about you?
nice! Im studying Information Technology
Cool cool! I've heard that's a pretty tough major.
yeah the winter sememster was a tough one but i got through it!
Is that in the business school or is IS in the business school?
IS is
And congrats! I'm glad you survived haha.
thanks haha
So what's the best class you have ever taken at BYU?
hmmm my UX Design Team class my professor and I started it last semester and it was a blast because we got to work with real companies and do UX work for them
Oh that's awesome!! Did you work in big groups or individually?
iin groups and we switched around
I wish there was something like that in my major. It would be great!
whats your major?
Exercise science!
oh cool1 why are you in that major?
I love science! It's amazing. And learning about the human body and how everything interacts just makes me feel like I understand what's going on. You know?
yeah i feel you do you want to become a nurse?
Oh definitely not. I will be going on to do a PhD in immunology.

Hello
Hey how are you?
I am doing well, its good to meet up again
Yeah I just got home It's been a rough day
Oh no, what happened?
Ugh I drove for 3 hours
That can be a long drive Did you have any good music playing?
Yeah. I played the greatest showman and then I just played my general playlist
I used to not like driving and think that anything took forever. But then After highschool I started driving more and more, almost all day every day. Now driving isnt too bad. Things go by a lot quicker And the greatest showman soundtrack helps a ton
Yeah. My legs always get tired when I drive. I don't know why. After a while my leg muscles start to burn
Hm thats interesting, do you use cruise control? Or do you keep your foot on the gas the whole time?
Cruise control
Nice, then I have no clue. But I guess sometimes pushing the pedal helps me not just cramp up I dont know
Yeah. Me neither it sucks. Also I still don't have my test scores. The suspense is killing me
I am waiting on two more exam scores as well. I dont like waiting It is pretty suspenseful
Yeah. I am waiting on two as well.
The worst is when you forget about it, and you are having a good time. And then you get your score back and its not a good one
I have As in all my other classes and I am happy about that so I should forget the last two and be patient. Oh yeah that is the worst.
It caught me off guard, and usually I am pretty patient and understanding. I dont know why it made me so upset that time I guess just because I wasnt expecting it
I would be disappointed if I got a bad score on either one.
Im sure you did well if you have "A's" in everything else I have been trying to finish all of my food before moving out and I had all this cream cheese left and I found out that cream cheese goes well with chicken and potatoes
Hmmm Are you there?
Are you not getting my messages? I am still here
No I am now What did you say?
what is the last thing that you got?
The one that said I guess I just wasn't expecting it
Oh I just said I am sure you did well if you have A's in your other classes
Did you say anything else?
Nothing else important, just that I was trying an interesting combination of food, cream cheese and chicken
Ohhhhh that is weird I can't believe I didn't get it.
Its actually pretty good Did nothing show up at all?
What is No
Hm, weird The chicken and cream cheese is what I was saying is pretty good
I can see what you are saying now though. Whthay doesn't make sense I didn't get the context.
Nevermind, it doesnt matter What are your plans now that you are home again?
Just hang out with my family.
Oh right, that will be so much fun Does your family play board games or anything together?
It will be. They will be at school during the day though
Like what do you like to do with them?
Yeah we do. How about yours? We play videogames Drive places and do hikes Just whatever How about you what do you do with your family?
That sounds like so much fun to do those things together! With my family we like to go try new food, play card games, go out on the boat, or go on walks
That's always fun. We used to go on walks when I was younger. Now that we live out in the middle of nowhere it is way different Do you ever do family reunions? Those are interesting.
Haha I am sure, I mean where would you walk to? One side of the family does, I have never been before. But this June I will be going to my first one!
We would walk around the block. Along the way we would pass members of our ward. We took our dog along with us as well and it was a privilege to be the one who got to hold the Leash
Haha how often were you the one who was able to hold the leash? And what kind of dog?
Wow hope you enjoy it. Family reunions are weird for me because it is usually a bunch of people I don't know It is a Maltese poodle. Right now she is like 13 years old I think. Don't quote me on that. Oh I almost always held the leash I was the dogs favorite
Nice! I am excited, I am sure I wont know most people but it will be good time spent with the ones I do
After I left on my mission she forgot me and now she has another favorite
did you feed the dog? Is that why you were her favorite
Yeah that is true. No I just spent a lot of time with her And I would rub her back Sounds like a key formula If only that worked for girlfriends
Hahaha that is funny If only it were that easy
Yeah, it isn't though.
Do you have any crazy dating stories?
I have a few, but I need to go to bed. We can talk about them more next time. It was nice chatting with you! Good night!

Hello?
Hello:)
So what would you do with a flying car?
I would fly over seas to visit other continents What about you?

No, computers cannot fall in love
I wouldnt think so either How is your night going?
It's going pretty good. I'm just spending time at home with my family
Oh thats nice!
What about you?
I just finished up work and taking a little break I have been indexing documents all day
Cool! What kind of work do you do?
I work for my Dad for marketing and all the office work for his business Right now it is organizing all the previous leads the company has had
Nice, I had a similar job last year. I had an internship at a nuclear powerplant and was the administraative assistant. dealing with papers was a large segment of my day Do you like office work?
Oh that sounds like it would still be interesting, what did you do the other half of the day? I like organizing, Ill be more excited to do the social media work and logo design
I organized and ran meetings and sometimes helped the graphics department design banners and posers. It just kind of depended on the week
That sounds sweet
You're interested in graphic design?! That's so cool!
Yeah I really like a lot of art
Me too! I actually plan on going into illustration. What type of art do you like?
Sweet! I do photography, drawing, graphic design, painting Really anything I can get my hands on
I mostly do digital art. I love doing fan art and comissions for people. Bringning other peoples' characters to life is super fun Do you have a favorite artist?
Oh that is cool! What kinds of stuff have you done I really like James Kirk Richards and Rose Datoc Doll
I have had an author reach out to me to design her characters which was super fun. My dream job is to illustrate for books so it was a great opportunity Then I just do random people's requests. My favorite one so far has been this one character that has ight powers and is from a steam punk society. light
That is really cool that you have had the opportunity to do all of that How do you figure out what the person wants in the art
Also, my favorite artists are Gabriel Picolo and Charlie Bowater I have then email or DM me the description of their characters and an idea of what they want the picture to look like And then I send them updates throughout the process to make sure I'm doing what they want
I just looked up those artists they have really cool stuff That seems like a good way to make sure they are happy I do that with pictures I take, I send a few to make sure they like the edits
Your artists have amazing work as weel! They both have such interesting styles Do you photograph at events?
I really love how unique their styles are Yeah I do weddings, engagements, family, all sorts of stuff
Thats awesome! I imagine wedding photos would be my favorite if I were a photographer. Do you have a preference?
I just like one on one portraits It is the least stress and the easiest to manage Weddings are great and beautiful, but they take so much work And trying to manage so many people it can be really stressful
I bet haha, so many guests and pressure.
Yeah and they all want you to do different things for pictures
What is the best picture you have ever taken True, plus its probabaly hard to round everyone up for big group pictures, especially if they have a big family with lots of little kids
Kids are great But so many kids You just cant get them all to look Um I dont know what it would be I have different favorites and they change
Same here, I dont think I could pick a favorite drawing. I would end up showing anyone who asked at least ten peices
Hahah yeah Let me just whip out this slide show real quick
seriously though haha. We could be there for hours and then the other person would get bored and would awkwardly have to find an excuse to leave lol
Hahaha yeah
I'm also a huge book nerd and a lot of my stuff is fan art so I'd probabaly end up spoilng an entire book for the poor guy
Hahaha What is your favorite book?
uhhhhhh this is like the favorite picture question haha
Haha well what is a good one you have read most recently
I like everything by ySarah J. Maas, the selection sereis, Shatter me series
Hm I have never heard of her
Her books are so good!! The new one just came out this week and im painfully waiting for my library to get it haha. What about you? Do you like reading?
I like reading when I take the Time to do that
[Also, Sarah J. Maas didnt write the series I listed after that. those are just other books I like] Have you read anything by Brandon Sanderson?
I havent I feel silly saying I like to read and I dont know any of the authors
It's all good haha. What type of books do you read
I am reading my favorite books from growing up again They are the Guardian of gahoole series
Are those the cat worrior books? NO WAIT those are the owl books!! I've totally read those
Haha yeah I love owls So it was my favorite And its fun to read it again, I dont remember a lot of these
Did you see the movie they made of those books?
I did! I love it It took a lot out, but it is still about owls and way cool
yeah, they did a pretty good job on that movie I'm always so worried when books i like are being made into movies
Yeah it can be tricky and kinda risky I was hoping they would make another I care for when they leave a dramatic ending that totally could be a a follow up movie
Yeah, they did that with the fallen series movie. left everyone on a complete cliff hanger and then canceled the second movie
I WOULD BE SO MAD
I KNOW RIGHT!! I'm still very disapointed
I cant stand watching TV shows that do "to be continued" either I refuse
Same haha, but sometimes I get into a show and then it evolves into one and then I'm trapped
AND THAT IS THE WORST You love and hate it
Yup.i also hate it hwen you get into a show only to find out the next season is coming out in a year
Yes That is of the devil I know there are a ton of shows that I would get into But I wont let myself watch them And then eventually I can just binge them
Ugh, im actualy waiting for the next season of Victoria to come out.... in september 2019: [I am too weak to resist haha. The torute seems woth it at the time, until you finish the existing seasons and then its just insanity
Hahaha I am sorry for your loss
RIP
Ill write a eulogy
Thank you, i would do the same for you, but youre too smart to get trapped in the cruel games of tv shows
You would think, but sometimes I am weak Like for Brooklyn 99
I LOVE THAT SHOW
Oh me too
It's so funny haha. Who is your favorite character? I love Gina and Captain Holt And jake, and Charles, and basically all of them
Gina is my spirit animal I love her And Rosa
Yassss and Jake+Amie the best Amy*
Haha they are cute Are you caught up?
Not all the way. I am in the current season though. wbu?
I just watched the most recent one yesterday
Do you watch it on hulu?
I do
Me to, I share the acount with a bunch of family though so sometimes i cant watch it because other people are already logged in
Oh that isnt fun
but its free this way so....-\ [**]
Oh I pay for mine and other people mooch off me
^My atempt at the shrugging shoulders emoji haha I am the moocher in this case haha
Haha I can appreciate that I just figure my sister buys me a lot of food, so it works out And she and her husband take me to movies occasionally
I am a movie theatre adict haha. I have the movie pass that lets you watch one movie a day for just $10 a month
I have heard about those!
I dont go every day but its super nice when I'm bored
Do you like it? Thats good
I LOVE IT!!! like, i can go to the super nice theatre with the reclining chairs which usually costs $13 a ticket as much as i want for just $10 a month. its crazy
I would probably do that If there was a good line up of movies coming out And if I had a way to get to the theater But I dont have time or a ride so right now it wouldnt be worth it
yeah, that is definatley a problem haha. I wont have a car at school so im enjoying it while it lasts
Nice! Live it up What movies are you excited for
Infinity wars was awesome, and overboard was hillariou, there is this one movie coming out soon called adrift that im really excited for It has the girl from the "fault in our stars" and the guy that plays fynnik in "the Hunger Games" in it.
OH I SAW THE PREVIEWS I want to see that
and incredibles 2
yes yes yes
SAME!!! And its a true story so thats super crazy And only been waitng AN ENTIRE DECADE for incredibles 2 im so pumped
Oh me too I love the previews Have you seen the one with Frozones wife Well she speaks but they didnt show her
yes haha. She is iconic
I would have been so mad if they didnt include her I am also excited for the next fantastic beasts
Oh yeah! I forgot about that one. it has Ezra Miller in it right?
Uh... I dont really know names
the one guy from justice leage that played the flash?
I havent seen that yet Is it good?
It was pretty good. I really liked the cast I'm kinda a marvel person though so I can't say I Loved it without being a traitor;)
Haha I like marvel better too
Whats your favorite marvel movie?
I like doctor strange or spiderman home coming
spiderman homecoming is definately one of my favorites. I'm low key in love with tom holland [the guy that plays spiderman]
I know his name He is awesome Haha
just making sure haha. that is definately a name worth knowing. have you seen black panther yet
I have:) THat is a good one also I love zendaya too
Me too! She is so awesome! Her ar tin greatest showman was awesome! and her outfit at the met gala was amazing
I follow her on instagram and sometimes I foget she is famous and I am like oh yeah how is my friend zendaya doing
haha thats awesome! I feel like she would be the coolest friend ever.
Can you imagine having a friend like her and tom Ugh I want a celebrity friend
I imagine it all the time..... it would be magical haha
It really would
and ned from homecoming would be awesome to. Like, i just want to join the friendgroup that they are in in the movie and then my life would basically be comlete [Sorry, I've let my syntax go haha. My spelling and capitalization are all over the place]
haha no worries I want more spiderman movies with tom
same, i need them
I need all of them One day I will meet them
same, a lot of the marvel guys are going to be at comicon in seattle the end of june and to get a vip to meet all of them is over $1,000 but,
Oh my goodness It would be worth it if I got a friend out of it
the Tom VIP which includes an meet and greet and a picture with tom with some other stuff costs $500...
Id pay 1000 for a friend like tom WORTH IT
same man, same theoretically, i could make it... but i would probably lose my job and i would also be taking like $1000 out of my college savings maybe next year haha
Yeah... That is a lot in terms of college expenses its like one solid book
true hahahaha i mean.... if tom halland fell in love with me and we got maried... would i really need a college fund at all?
Probably not Do you think if you messaged them through instagram they would ever see it?
maybe, ive considered doing that but what would you say that would catch their attention enough to reply?
I dont even know I would want to draw them something Impress them with my art
would you want to give off the "im here to be your friend, not because your a celebrity and im not like other girls" vibe or would you go for the " please speak to me, ILY" aproach?
Hahahaha A little of both I am sure they have heard it all I doubt they would even open the messages they get
same, art is the way to the heart
Maybe they would for fun sometime and see it But dont they have millions of followers
i think youre on to something with the art aproach. just made a super bomb art peice and post it and tag tom in it and then he woud see it and be like "dang i must talk to this person"
more like " I must friend this person" Then he would ask to hang out
Yeah, they do have millions of followers but i have seen people do the art thing and tom will follow them for it YES!!
NO FLIPPING WAY I am totally making art of tom and zendaya
and then you would go on the coolest date ever and get his number and next thig yo know youre going to the red carpets together do it! i support this plan
Haha well for me Tom and I could be friends, I dont think He runs that way Maybe the coolest date with zendaya She rocks the red carpet events though, I dont know how I could even stand near her there
hahah sorry, i was going to ask if you were a guy or a girl but i didnt know if we were supposed to with the rules haha this works out great then, i have tom all for myslef and you have zendaya. the is an even better plan
Haha no worries We can be like celebrity couple friends It will work out great We both do the art for them And they keep being amazing
YAS and we can all thank the BYU chit chat for it. what a great story that would be haha
Hahaha I really want this to happen
yup, plus well probabaly become famous artists becasue everyone will ewant the art that got tom and zendayas attention me too, my hopes are getting too high
Yeah I will be thoroughly disappointed Do you think Zendaya will end up being like the new lady gaga
I wouldt say lady gaga, but i think she is going to be pretty huge as far a celebrities go. I thik shes to down to earth to be gaga
Yeah I was just thinking that she does a lot of wigs and crazy awesome outfits did you see her most recently? with the medevial one
her joan of arc outfit was pretty sweet though
I think she is more down to earth too Yeah! that one is so awesome
Yes!! it is so cool and ive literally seen so much fan art of it already. its crazy instagram is an amazing place
there has been a lot? Dang I am behind Maybe what you need to do is draw what she should wear next
theres been a good amount. at least in my little relm of artists i follow theres an idea.... what woud you draw
I dont even know
me either... i cant even decide if i would go with a dress or a casual outfit or a high fashion look like the ones her brother designs
Maybe something like a roman or greece look But with a little extra flair
That would be cool
What would you do?
or like a steampunk look
Yeah!
ugh i wish were were allowed to know eachother haha
Maybe at the end! Two people I have talked to have figured out who I am haha
but along with this zendaya, would we throw tom in the picture as well
They just gleaned enough information from conversation to do it Probably
interseting...
They go well together
yeah... but just as friends;)
Oh for sure
they arent allowed to be with eachother haha
they would be a terrible couple I called dibs first tom
yeah, not only is he mine and her yours, but zendaya also has a good three inches on him
How tall is she
like 5'10 maybe?
Okay so she couldnt wear heels with me
yup its 5'10
Otherwise I would need some extra boost in my shoes
are you 5'10?
Im like 5 11
also, i couldnt wear heels with tom and im fine with that you and zendaya will still work he is one ince taller than me
Nice! See this is all working out so nicely
ikr! now we jsut gotta make that fan art and get this thing rolling
What day should we schedule the weddings should they be like around the same time? Or like? hahah I guess that is jumping a few steps
hmmmm maybe like march of next year?? then we have time to meet them, seal the deal, and then time to work off the holiday chub
Perfect
plus march has good weather
I see now flaw no*
idk how ill handel the paparazi though...they will be all over the story of two commoners falling in love with two super awesom celebs
It will be horrific to deal with the paparazi
^once again sorry about the typos, ive stopped proof reading messages before i send them haha
No worries I type too fast and do the same I get a little lazy
same, plus im not using my phone so it doesnt auto correct for me first world problems haha
Seriously
i think the first story the paparazi would have on me is " tom hollands girl caught cleaning out baker... what a beast" bakery*
hahahahahaha im dead oh my goodness
thye would have pics of me savagely eating fistfulls of pastries and there would be an action shot of me chucking a mangles brownie at the lense mangled*
Hahahahaha then tom in the background with you
carrying the rest of my boxes with look of amusement and admiration on his face probably handing me my next "weapon"
Hahaha Then Zendaya and I would be in the self serve Ice cream place just pouring it all into our mouths directly
yessss hahaha or you would be the people that bring the giant popcorn tubs and fill them with soft serve haha
Oh yes And then wear all sorts of wigs WE COULD HAVE COUPLE WIGS AND THEMED OUTFITS
heck yeah!! and fake mustaches to desguise yourselves
Hahaha
your fan art should just be a pic of you and zendaya wearing coordinating outfits. that would be a great conversation starter
I want this all to happen so bad
same... it seems weirdly possible hey do any of your favorite artists have instagrams
Mine is glitching way bad I dont know if you can see any of this

no not at all we do it all the time and we turn them back on anyway
I feel like turning it off is actually good once in a while, if a computer isn't working correctly we turn them off and turn them back on anyway to fix them
yeah that is the fix all when you dont know what to do i hate it when it gets that bad
Yeah, or when the WiFi isn't working so you have to get up from whatever you're doing and go unplug it, does that ever happen to you? That happens all the time to me
yeah luckily at byu that never happens i sweaR they have google fiber or something the internet is always absolutely great
Yeah that sounds about right
have you been there?
Where?
to byu
Yeah I'm a student there
oh sweet a lot of the people i have talked to today are incoming freshmen
Oh cool, I'm a junior so now I feel old so that's great
but i guess you arent one of them haha oh wow you are old so you are going to be graduating pretty soon! what are you majoring in again?
Haha well I didn't think I was old until now! Neuroscience, we'llsee if I'm actually able to graduate next year
oh sweet i considered doing neuroscience how do you like it? I know a pair of twins in the program they are from my home town
Nice, it's difficult but a lot of fun. I've really loved it. So you're an incoming freshman too?
no heavens no do i look like an incoming freshmen to you?
Haha well how am I supposed to know? I thought I would only be old to a freshman
hahaha well you are old unless i am a senior which i am not i am a sophomore by the way
I kinda figured. And to be fair I'm technically the age of a sophomore because I graduated high school with my associates So I'm not old thank you very much

Hello!
That would be super cool if we had faster than light space travel But it would make things really interesting if it malfunctioned in anyway
It would be cool but I think it would be a bad call for humans to have that capability!
You would be millions of miles away from the desired location Why would it be a bad call?
Based on past experience humans would use it poorly Not based on past personal experience! I mean based on how humans have behaved in the past I think it would be a bad call But there would be lots of interesting adventures if it did malfunction I'm sure
Can you imagine the expense to the speed of light line [like an airline company I guess]
Ridiculously expensive I'm sure!
It would be terrible if you went too far by a fraction of a second and have to make up the cost to the people crazy enough to ride at the speed of light
But I still stand by my belief that it would be really bad for humans to have access to that power So many things could go wrong!
Also, if an asteroid or some floating object goes into tour path you are done for. So that wouldn't be very fun... Everyone would die. But the question is...would you feel anything? Probably not, it's gojng so fast Going
That's true...but isn't there a way to program your ship to avoid that? I'm drawing on Star Wars knowledge here not actual scientific knowledge
Probably but you would have to have a very precise instrument
You're probably right...I guess if we did have faster-than-light travel it would start out very primitive with lots of mishapscollisions then eventually more refined ways
Right
of doing things would be developed and people would be successfully able to navigate around stuff while traveling at the speed of light
It's a work in progress Bad in the end it would be really cool And in theory it's really cool But in the end
It would be more convenient for interstellar travel
My spelling is terrible today
It's okay!
We could go visit other planets! That would be cool!
But I think it would be a bad thing for humans to posses Someone would misuse it
And find out if there are aliens!
Do you think there are aliens?
And we could go visit a planet and get back before dinner time I don't deny that there may be aliens
Exactly! It would be commercialized into weekend excursion *excursions
But I can't confirm it either
Interesting, and why do you think that?
That would make cruises in the Bahamas look cheap!
Ha yeah! Maybe cruises would be cheaper
That would be the best I could convince all my friends to go to space and I enjoy cheaper criuses And that would bring a whole new meaning to "airline food" They would seriously have to pressure those cabins so the food doesn't get all over you. Too bad to that fellow who enjoys a nice hot beverage! And the fellow behind him haha
No kidding! There would be so many problems they'd have to fix But people are really inventitive so I'm sure it could be done
It would be way too complicated I'm sure they could figure it out
Not me haha someone else who is way smarter than me
Yeah, same That's a topic I'm not willing to touch
It makes me actually physically sick to think about the amount of math and science knowledge, time, and effort that would have to go into figuring that out
It would take multiple lifetimes I think Or at least a team of people that is way too big to imagine
It's probably something they've been working on for the past 50 or 60 years so eventually they'll figure it out
Yeah. Especially with all the technological advances they have continuously I've got to go but have a wonderful day!

Pumpkin ice cream?
Mmm. I like fall scents, too.
Aren't you the person who likes to eat alot?
Haha, yeah. I was right about to type how I like the smell of delicious Asian food, haha.
And likes HSM? And just got back from China?
Yes! That was probably the best conversation I've had about HSM
Haha how's it going?
It's great. Currently making Korean food. How was your Halloween?
Haha no way! Are you using gochujang? I love that you're cooking korean food at 10pm on Halloween!
Ah! No! I don't have a car, so I can't easily get to the Asian market, but I do need it for this recipe: bibimbap. I've elected to use sriracha instead. A false substitute. What better way to spend Halloween, haha?
Oh ok that sounds good. Do you watch food network?
I love Food Network. I haven't watched it recently, but I love most all the shows. Do you?
Yeah I like love Bobby Flay. Are you pro or anti-bobby?
He's pretty cool, but I prefer Cat Cora. She's Greek, and I'm Greek, so... But I'm not against Bobby Flay, haha.
Bobby can cook Greek though! I just love watching Beat Bobby Flay where people bring dishes they've been perfecting their whole lives and Bobby's never cooked before ever and he beats them at it.
Oh I know! That's so crazy! I love Iron Chef.
Do you like Guy Fieri?
Yeah, he's cool! I once ate at one of his Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives spots.
Oh really? Was it any good or did they just like try their best when Guy came?
I just remember they had an awesome salsa bar, haha. It was a while ago. Did you ever watch "Unwrapped?"
No, is it on Food Network?
I don't know if it is anymore, but it was behind the scenes of making foods like twinkies or noodles. Pretty neat.
Oh I love twinkies! It makes me so sad when people rag on them! If you could have a room FULL of twinkies or a $100 gift card to Cafe Rio which would you choose?
Well, I'm not one for sweets. I can barely eat a whole cookie sometimes, so I'd have to say Cafe Rio. But if I loved sweets, then I'd probably choose the twinkies, haha.
Oh interesting! Even donuts?
Donuts are worse than cookies, haha. The only sweet thing I can eat without getting immediately tired of it is ice cream.
Wow! No wonder you're cooking on Halloween night! Did you have like a bad experience with sweet things when you were a kid?
Haha, no! I have no idea why I don't like sweets. And I went trick or treating till I was 17 [and yesterday, actually]. I even have a drawer dedicated to candy and snacks, but I just never get around to eating it, haha. I could eat savory, salty, spicy and sour things all day.
Okay so would you choose Panda over Cafe Rio?
Panda. Hands down. Asian food always trumps any other cuisine. What about you?
I would choose Cafe Rio. What's the one thing you always get at Panda?
Beijing Beef. So good. Do you prefer tacos or burritos? Or something else entirely?
Burritos just seem bigger and more satisfying to me. Do you like sushi?
Same! Love burritos! Oh man. Probably too much. I had a sushi dream the other night, haha. Do you?
Aww that's true sushi passion! Yeah I'm usually pretty cautious about it though. Where's the best sushi? Do you like sushi burrito?
I liked the sushi at King Buffet. I actually don't normally buy sushi since it can be so expensive. Is that a place??
Oh I didn't know they did sushi at King Buffet! Yeah there's a place called Sushi Burrito. The last time I got sushi was at Koi Express and there was just way too much seaweed and it overpowered everything else.
Yeah! It's a good variety. I will be looking those places up! Now I want sushi. But, I mean, I always want sushi. So what else do you like to do? Any hobbiesinterests?
I'm really into procrastinating and tennis and cycling.
Hahaha! Oh cool! Wow, I'm impressed. Do you compete?
No, I played in high school but could never do it at the college level. Are you into any sports?
Let's just say cooking is my sport. I'm probably the most out of shape person you'll ever meet, haha. But I like hiking. And I like watching sports. Olympics and World Cup are the best!
Aww hiking is the worst! Have you hiked the Y? Winter or Summer Olympics?
I've hiked it once, but it's kinda a boring hike. I've done Angel's Landing in Zion NP twice, though. Oh, that's hard. I never know. I like the snowboarding and stuff in Winter, but I like the racing and stuff in summer. Do you have a favorite?
Is angel's landing one of the ones where you risk falling off a cliff or something? I think the summer events are way more interesting.
Haha, yeah, that's the one! It has some precarious areas, but a great view!
I would be too freaked out.
Yeah, I think if it came down to it, I'd pick summer, too. Yeah, the second time I did it, it was a lot scarier. Have any plans for Thanksgiving?
No plans currently. I love mashed potatoes though.
Same. That's my favorite Thanksgiving food.
Do you like it with the potato peels in it?
Yes! Do you?
Yeah it's the best! I just love eating mashed potatoes and dinner rolls!
Yes! Do you like to make little turkey sandwiches with the rolls and mashed potatoes?
Yeah do you like white or dark meat more?
Dark meat. The white always seems dry. You?
I actually prefer white. Dry meat never bothers me for some reason.
That's I talent, I believe, haha. What's your favorite holiday?
I've gotta say Christmas. It's just so much more magical than other holidays. But new years is more party like. It's a great time of year minus the snow.
Yes, same! There really is that magic to it. So, not a fan of the snow, huh?
No but I'm not a fan of super hot weather either. If there's a place that feels like how monday felt all the time that would be the perfect place!
Haha, I agree!
But the seasons are amazing so it's worth the extreme weather.
Yeah. I love getting all the seasons. Like, I would never live in the Southwest or near Canada. Too hot or too cold. Is there a state you'd prefer to live in?
For some reason I'd like to live in Montana. Like out in the wild.
Ooh. Like, on a ranch?
Well no because I don't want to enslave any cows. Maybe like a cow refuge! Like they can come and go as they please. Unlimited cow food and stuff for them.
Aw, that would be awesome! Cows are so cute. Do you have a favorite animal?
Oh cats for sure! It would be a cat refuge! You're a dog person aren't you?
What makes you say that? I love cats! I would much rather have a cat than a dog.
Oh good! I thought that since you liked cows you would like dogs.
Haha, I just love all animals, I guess. My favorite is a sloth.
Don't the claws freak you out though?
No, there's just so cute!
Is Ice Age your favorite movie then?
Haha, never seen Ice Age, haha. Honestly, that sloth creeps me out. But there's a giant ground sloth skeleton at the BYU Paleontology Museum you should check out!
Oh I've never been to the paleontology museum. Is the skeleton huge?
For a sloth, massive. It's a nice museum. I like all the campus museums.
If you could, would you walk around all day with a sloth like hanging on to you?
Oh yes! Like that dude in the Croods!
I don't know who that is. Do you believe in dinosaurs?
Oh, it's just a Dreamworks movie, haha. I believe they existed, yes. Do you?
I think they did but it bothers me when they start making the colored illustrations of what they think they looked like. Like how do you know what color it was when you only h ave the bones??
Oh true! Actually, my sister does paleoart! In some cases, scientists do know at least some of the colors, but most of it is up for the artist's interpretation.
Oh cool! Who does she do the art for?
Just for fun right now. Once she got to have a booth in a children's section of the Smithsonian, though. Well, my food is finally ready, haha. I better head out and get ready for bed. But I had fun chatting with you again! Hopefully we'll chat again soon!

Holy frijoles, well, probably I would talk about being organized and how that has helped me immensely with grades, etc. Maybe I'd be able to think of something more exciting..
hey hey hey that is a great subject
Thanks! What would you talk about?
I would talk about what type of personalities and traits you need to become a populate video game streamer
Interesting, do you stream videos?
no i don't I think i would be a terrible streamer haha
lol, I'm sure you'd do okay if you know what sorts of traits are necessary!
hahahaha
Whaddya think of this experiment thing?
I like to watch streamers and I found that a lot of the successful streamers have similar traits that the viewers are attracted to
Okay, what sorts of traits in particular?
You obviously have to be good at the game but lets take that out you have to be entertaining and be very personable a lot of people ask not just gaming questiosn but life questions as well on game streams its really weird
Yeah, I suppose you'd have to be able to talk and talk and still be entertaining. Wait so can the audience respond while they are streaming? How does that work?
so the audience donate money to have their questions to be seen live. and the streamers can see it and they will read it and respond to the questions

hello?
hi

Have you tried the flavored peanut butter? Like chocolate?
I havent tried the actual pb but I have tried the chocolate powdered peanut butter

Heyo
hey whats up how is the day going?
Hey how goes it?
its going pretty well i asked you first though hahaha
Haha fine. I'm doing pretty fantastic here
what is the most bizarre thing that has ever happened to you?
That has happened to me? Hmm I don't know if this is necessarily the same thing but want to know a kind of super power i have? It'll probably sound weird
sure
So you know how there is water in the air right?
yeah
Well, if I cross my eyes when I'm outside [I think I have to be outside in the middle of the day for it to work] I can see it Like little bubbles teeny tiny
really?
Really truly
what is it?
What do you mean what is it? It's the water vapor in the air
the bubbles you saw

something that I am embarrassed about that I don't know much about that I should know is that I should know more about the curernt events like wars that are happening right now in like middle east and other countries that the media does not talk about or discuss because I think that the war like in Burma is some thing that needs our attention but no one cares about it for some reason. The buddhists there are trying to kill all the muslims for some reason. It is the longest civil war in history every I think its been like 90 years. Its really sad.
holy cow I had no idea.... that is crazy

Hello?
HeyXD i swear we are not the only two people on this thing
Which one should we keep?
this one
Sounds like a good deal I closed them So the problem was fixed for me but Will be fixed tomorrow or the next day for everyone It is more complicated to code it For now just try to keep the hanging monkeys to like 1 or 2 That will help How has your day been
gotcha, it's been good. super good cause i didn't have to work XD how about you?
Hello? Are you still there?
yeah you didn't get my message?
Oh, if you responded I didn't get your message. What was it that you said?
it was a good day, a super good day cause i didn't have to work XD wbu?
Was a good day for me because I didn't have to work and I only had one class and for the most part they are fixing C cc Do you run in to ghost chats much anymore?
where do you work and what class did you have? ghost chats?
I don't work anywhere I guess that was kind of the point It was just something else I can say that was nice
hahaha oh my goodness XD that's the funniest thing ive heard all day haha
Ha ha sorry I guess I am just looking at the silver lining a little too closely I suppose there's always something to be grateful for Then again I'm not making money so that's kind of sad
hey, it's great to not be working. im working now so later at BYU i don't have to XD
Are you making lots of money? I'm guessing you have a job?
No, im not making as much as i would like, and yeah i do
That is a smart choice. I am just trying to get a good grade so that I can get How much nine an hour? I think that's OK and fairly average but personally to me that's not super much Depends on where you working
lol i wish 7.50 right now im a cashier
Holy cow they are ripping you off!!! You are worth far more than 750 an hour that is absolutely ridiculous
yeah i know: im trying to find a new job but its been a struggle
If you think about it when this competition would be worth much more than that What is your major again sorry
lol why do you think im doing it XD haha nursing you there? hellooooooo?

Hello Ew, if computers ever got the right to vote, I'd move to Mars
hello! I don't think they'll ever get the right to vote
That would be too weird Like what would they vote on that would affect them?
Computers are programed by people, so ultimately youd be giving the people multiple votes you feel? yeah exactly it's too weird to think about
Haha true. So are you a male or female?
What's your favorite color and why? I think I really like lighter shades of green because they make me feel really philisophical I am male lol I think everybody on here is to be honest Also yeah
Haha well I'm a female so
oh really
Sure am
That's a first for me nice are you single:P i kid i kid But anyways, I'm a freshman
Haha I am single. You're a freshman? That's cool.
So it's pretty chill for me right now hahaha
I'm a sophomore
Nice nice
Which class of yours was this announced in?
marketing management what about you?
Oh so you're trying to get into the Business School?
yeah for sure
It was in my intro to the school of family life
that is the ultimate goal oh gotcha that seems pretty cool
Take your classes seriously bro. There's lots of competition
How ling have you been doing this for? yeah I beleive it I'm aiming for a 4.0 lol so i'm taking them fairly seriously
I was going to try to go into the business school, but econ kicked my butt
oof I'm in it now But i've been puting in the hours of work
I also realized that I'm dumb when it comes to economics and such, so I switched to my major now which is the best thing I've ever done
So I'll do okay i hope
Who are you taking Econ from?
Butler I take it on wednesday nights and I guess it's good that you made that realization early on haha also I got to go get some dinner right now! it was good to talk to you! it's been real

ahh I honestly have no idea!!
oh hahaha I think I would go back when Bitcoin was like 2 cents
Yeah there you go!!!
and buy as much bitcoin as I can

mr incredible
Hmmmmmmm I'd have to say nikola tesla
nice.
he was a rad dude and got no credit for what he did
He got some credit I believe
He got some later after people realized that he was genius. But Edison tried to shut him down over and over so he kinda got swept under the rug for a long time
wow. rude much edison?
yeah I mean he was an amazing inventor but he also hated competition and tesla was a super smart guy as well in the end we use a bunch of stuff that both of them invented so i guess the competition might of been a good thing
yeah! he was also, I think I'm gonna pass out soon. I am so sorry. i am just so exhausted for some reason
Haha I totally get ya! Im running on fumes right now so once this dr pepper wears off I'm going to sleep
I'm probs gonna sign off now lol
sound good. cya tomorrow most likely haha

Ohhhhh boy I've got a few whacky ones, so buckle up First of all I can play the piano upside-down
Hey me too!
DUDE yesssss
I'm working on All of me upside down
That's fantastic I can speak spanish in a solid Australian accent I can balance pineapples on my head really well and walk or dance with them balanced aaaaand I have a superpower for puns about cheese Some people think I'm a munster because I have soooo many puns about cheese, but I just tell one of the many haters that it's "nacho time to criticize me" What about yourself?
Haha that is impressive
Haha why thank ya kindly
Okay so tell me if this is really weird
Oh boy
But you know how there is water in the air?
Yesh
Well I've been able to see it
Whoa whoa How so?
Like if I go cross-eyed I can see little bubbles
Whooaaaaa Ok wow that's wild Do you live in a really humid place? Or can you do that basically anywhere?
I mean I guess I don't think about it a ton It kinda hurts to be cross eyed for so long so I haven't done it in a while I think as long as I'm outside I usually can..
Que interesante That's pretty stellar I'm not gonna lie
Haha sometimes I think people will think I'm crazy

Well the first thing I would do with a magic wand is sing Bippity- Boppity Boo And then after that who knows
I'd learn to apparate. Travel to Hogwarts Learn magic Curse Malfoy and all his descendents After that, who knows?

Hmmm i would have holes in my chest. I bet they would be ferocious and untamable
That's funny! I was thinking more about My Little Pony, but violent unicorns are definitely more entertaining.
Hahaha
5-year-old me would freak out!
Hahaha yeah they wluld come close and you would go to pet them and they would chase you all around Have you ever read any good books
Does Harry Potter qualify?
Nice recently?
Well I read it for the first time right after kindergarten [I learned to read pretty early] so my childhood friends were Harry, Hermione, and Ron...
Woah when did you start the harry potter series?
Well my grandpa got me into them the summer after kindergarten, so I was reading them throughout first grade. I didn't always understand the words or some of the more emotionally deep scenes, but the story captivated me and I loved the whole magic world.
Wow that is impressive I started reading in like 3rd or fourth grade I had seen the movies and was pilled in and made the next movie wasnt out yet so i just read the books Turns out the books are always way better haha
Exactly! I yell at my youngest sister whenever she is too lazy to go read the book. What's your favorite genre?
I love sciecne fiction, fantasy and just teen novels in general. I haven't read a lot recently
School makes it hard to find time to really dive into personal reading.
Yeah. I don't count linear algebra It isnt that fun Kind of dry and humorless
?
Math is in general
Something is wrong with my computer, sorry to spam that question mark.
Hahaha I only saw one
Sometimes your text boxes as you type fill up the whole page but they usually disappear to just show one copy Anyways, yeah no, also not a math girl.
Yeah What sounds like something good to eat for dinner
I like Asian food. I went to a really good Pad Thai restaurant and had noodles and shrimp. 1010.
Do pot stickers count as asian food?
YES! That's my dad's favorite thing to make when my mom isn't looking.
Oh I love potstickers. Why does he wait till your mom isn't looking?
Because he always does it after my mom already cleaned up from cooking dinner earlier, so he tries to escape from cleaning lol
Oh hahaha
What kind of potstickers are you eatingmaking

I think that feeding pets would definitely be easier i they could talk LOL And perhaps animal abuse would be less common if pets could speak up for themselves
yeah thats a good point they could all get together an fight back against the humans
I wonder if they'd all speak the same language Or if Americal pets would speak English and Japanese pets would speak Japanese *american
or they just speak whatever language their owners speak do you have any pets?
No. I used to have two cats but they both got old and passed You?
aww thats too bad I don't have any but I've always wanted to get a dog
I love dogs:)
are you more of a cat person or dog person?
I think I love both. If it came down to it, I'd probably get a dog though because I feel like they're more active and affectionate You?
I'm okay with kittens, but I don't really like cats because I've had experiences with mean ones.
Aw, that That's too bad I can totally understand that. I didn't really like cats until I had cats Do you want pets in the future?
Yeah whenever i have my own house or an apartmentment that allows pets i'll get a dog
Aw, what kind?
I really like german shepherds, but I'd have to get used to the shedding
Haha, yeah. You'd never be able to wear anything black without seeing hair! But they're worth it I want a corgi
awwww they are adorable! did you know there are huskycorgi mixes?
I knoww. They're my favorite kind of dog Wow, I just googled huskycorgi and they are SO cute!! Did not know that! Thanks for sharing!
yeah I found it out for a school project. I had to come up with a way to teach kids about genetics and my group made a game where you had to match up the puppy with its parent

Hwy Hey
Hello again
Haha to answer your last question, no I don't think we watched that last video
What is your favorite food?
I really love Mexican food! What about you?
I like me a good steak Mexican food is good yeah What do you think about video games?
Haha nice. How do you like your steam? Steak*
medium rare T-bone ribeye
I don't really play video games haha sorry I know nothing about them
I don't mean specific video games, I mean general Some people think that its a waste of time, or that is causes violence... etc.

Hello again! Sorry I couldn't see my chat so I started a new one.
Yeah it does that sometimes But you were telling me a story about your sister Please continue!
Yeah I was saying that she's going to get her license soon and that its weird because she's turning 21 this year. She didn't ever had a rush to get her license because she was super popular in high school that she didn't need to drive Everyone drove her around everywhere and picked her up too but now that she has to take driving tests and finally needs to learn, she's started! It's kind of scary teaching her how to drive. I'm not going to lie but there's times when I feel terrified for my life. I guess it's only natural to feel that way since it's a beginner learning how to drive but still... She does a good job though. She listens very well to what I have to tell her and she tries to apply it. I think she'll be a great defensive driver.
Yeah that's crazy how she's learning how to drive so late! I guess it's better to do it now than to put it off for later
I remember the first time I learned how to drive. It was a scary experience for me too. But I consider my self a very good driver now. I haven't received a ticket and haven't been in a car accident! I take a lot of pride in that. However, my brother has been in a car accident and it was his fault too. It happened while he was on his mission. He told me they were kind of in a rush because their dinner appointment was far away and they needed to get there on time. He served in Long Beach and when we went to visit there after he was released I checked out the places he lived at. He parked the mission car in an alley because that's the only place that had parking available but the alley was super narrow and tiny!! Anyway that day when he had to go to the dinner that was far from their current location, the car was parked in the alley For missionaries, whenever they have to back the car out, their companion, whoever isn't the driver, has to get out of the car and guide them. This is to prevent the missionaries from getting in accidents but this method proved to be more of a bother than help. His companion was signaling him to slowly back out and so that's what he did. He looked back in the mirror to check for his companion's signal and backed out looking at the dimensions of the car to not scrape of dent it by hitting walls or posts. Most of the time when people back out, they're constantly looking back to see if a car is there or what not but my brother said because they have another person signaling when to back out, they get kind of complacent on constantly checking for cars. That's exactly what happened and because he wasn't looking to see if there was another car, he backed into one His companion was trying to signal him to stop but the other car was going about 25 in the alleyway when the guy should have been going like 10 It wasn't a big accident but their was a fender bender issue on both the cars involved. He said the man that was driving the other car was a mean guy too. My brother said it was his fault for not checking and just going with whatever his companion said at the time, but the other guy was unapologetic and demanded a lot of things from them.
Yeah! What a rude guy! I'm glad that everyone was ok though. Being in an accident can be a scary thing...
I know! That's why I'm kind of scared for my sister you know? It doesn't really matter how great of a driver you are or how careful you're driving. If someone is being stupid in the other car, you can easily get into an accident! But for my sister I think she just needs more time on the road. The more she drives, the more she'll get a feel for other cars around her She already does a good enough job so I'm not too worried but the thought of one of my family members getting in a car accident scares the crap out of me!
I feel you on that one. I would be heart broken if one of my family members or friends got seriously hurt from a car accident
My mom is a great driver too but she got lots of tickets when she first moved to the U.S. Since the traffic laws are different here and they have rules that Korea doesn't, my mom would unknowingly break traffic laws and get fined for it. She felt terrible for getting a ticker for what she didn't know about but she caught on quickly on how things worked. She obviously took tests and went to traffic school to learn things because they required it of her but her English was poor when she first moved that I'm not sure how much she really understood from attending those things. She's way better now and I can't remember the last time she got a ticket.
That sounds tough on your mom. Driving cars is the same but learning new traffic rules could feel very different if you're in another country
Yep! That's so true. My friends who served in Cambodia said that traffic laws there don't really exist. I guess it's a bad example since they're a third world country without any real structure yet but it's scary to hear what my friends had to describe about traffic there! There aren't any defining lines that separate lanes so people are just zooming past each other or acting like the road has four lanes when it can only fit two! One friend also told me about a round about they have. It's a traffic circle and from what they've said, it's almost like a fight for your life haha They just rush into the circle and for some odd reason, everyone is trying to go the speed of light! Lots of accidents happen at the traffic circle and I believe them! Going super fast around a circle and trying to get out to go on a different street could cause you to lost control or hit cars that you didn't see in your blind spot.
Yeah that's scary. I try to avoid things like that when I'm driving. I have heard of like 6 lane traffic circles in Europe Those ones are pretty scary too even with lines that define each lane
Yeah that's true... driving in general is super scary if you think about it. Being in a vehicle and going 80 miles per hour! It's crazy how fast we can go in cars. I was reading something the other day about traffic logistics and the group that did the study said that when you go over 90 miles per hour, there is no way anyone has a fast enough reaction time to avoid being in an accident. Because you're going so fast, by the time you recognize something wrong and try to avoid it, it's too late and the accident is underway. That's why it's always safe to drive cautiously...
That makes total sense
I'm not sure if I told you this already but my family and I took a vacation trip last year to Disneyland. None of us have ever been before except my sister who went during highschool. She had a school trip and was able to go. Anyway the rides were decent but I'm not sure I enjoyed all the hype Don't get me wrong, Disneyland was super big and it was magical like they said it would be on the ads but I'm not sure if I'd go again. I feel like it was just a one time thing for me and not sure if I want to go again. The rides there were very fun and well built but the lines you have to stand in before getting on one ride is absolutely ridiculous. I remember being in line for like 3 hours being getting on a ride that lasted like 3 minutes If I ever go to Disneyland again, it'll be for the scenery and to walk around to take the scenery in because Disneyland is beautiful That company truly has done a great job decorating that place and maintaining it.
Yeah Disneyland is actually a really fun place to visit! Not to mention that's its in California so there's a bunch of other stuff you could do or go see if you really wanted too
Yep! For our vacation we went to Disneyland for 1 day. We figured that was enough time to experience what Disneyland was like. Then we went to the beach and mostly ate lots and lots of delicious fod. food Since Disneyland is in Southern California, and it was close to where my brother had served his mission, we went to visit the ward his served in as well.
That must have been very fun for your family
Hey do you ever just think about random things when you're about to go to sleep or nap? I do all the time and some random thought I was having a while back is that we should be grateful for our bodies that require us to sleep Otherwise people would be making us work like 15-20 hours a day! Weird thought but could you imagine having to work that long?
Yeah that's an interesting thought. Without needing to sleep, there would be more time for people to use and take advantage of.
Another random thought I had one day was in regards to the LDS culture. As Mormons, we follow the Word of Wisdom that states that we don't drink alcohol, along with other subs substances What I thought of in regards to this was that when an alcoholic who's trying to recover and stop drinking is praised by those around him but people who never drank in their life are kind of looked down upon. Isn't it funny how that works? People look at us weird for not drinking but when some alcoholic tries to stop drinking they're praised. Weird society we live in with all these double standards haha
Yeah that's true. People do look down on the LDS community for a lot of things and that is one of them. Since Mormons don't drink, it's almost frowned upon.
Another thing I found myself laughing at was a saying that teachers had when I was in elementary school. It probably was actually said by people before too. Actually I'm po positive they said something similar My thought was: when I was going to school and we were learning the subject of math, I remember my teachers saying something like "you won't have mini calculators in your pock pocket to pull out to do your math for you!" Look at us now haha... Most of us have powerful phones that can do so many things. I guess it was hard for them to see a future in which things got so different. Or maybe they meant something else by what they said. Either way, I thought it was funny how the exact opposite came out to be.
Haha yeah I remember my teachers saying something like that too. That's why they always had us memorize and write things out.
I mean in honesty, being able to do math quickly is very helpful but what I find amusing was that we do have mini calculators in our pockets when they said we would never have something like that haha
lololol true true
So since Infinity War is out right now, I was thinking this is like the best time for kids to break their arms! It's kind of morbid for me to say something like that but hear me out lol That way when these kids get their hard cast, they can draw it up to be an infinity gauntlet! Wouldn't that be super cool? haha
Yeah that is actually pretty genius. Kids would go nuts over something like that haha
On a more serious note, I thought of something that kind of bothered me about our societal hierarchy. Everyone dislikes criminals. They break the law and inflict pain and suffering on other people. Yet, we seem to treat these people better than the homeless. I mean think about it. The criminals who break the law are being sent to prisons where they have free food, shelter, access to different workshops to be educated, and medical medical care Sure, they have their freedom taken away but if you compare that with the homeless who often made some dumb mistakes, I think the criminals have it better off.
Yeah interesting thought...
I've never been either so I can't really speak from experience [thank goodness] but on paper, it seems like it'd be better for someone to be a prisoner and have all the needs you require for sustninence be taken care of for you than a homeless person who's got nothing. If you think about it, being homeless isn't much freedom. Begging for food left and right and being in search of the next place to sleep is no way any human being should live. I think that's why so many homeless people commit crimes is because they are driven to that point in their life where they need to make rash decisions in order to survive.
Yeah i guess on paper it can look like one is better than the other but not all homeless people end up where they're at because of bad fortune Many made big mistakes in their life that cost them literaly everthing

If unicorns were real, then I think they would be very popular in birthday parties and zoos.
If you had one as a pet, what would you name it?
I would probably want to name it something basic, like Fred, just to be funny since the animal is held to such a high regard. What about you?
Ooh that's a good one. I'd have to consult My Little Pony before deciding on the best unicorn name
Haha, are there actually unicorns on My Little Pony, or are they just regular ponies? But I do recall a Rainbow Dash from that show, which I think is a pretty dope name.
Pretty sure there's a few unicorns...honestly I don't know haha. Have you ever read the Fablehaven series? The unicorn conversation reminded me of it
My siblings read that series and loved it! I read the first two books and then got a little bored on the third book, so I stopped reading it. Did you read the series?
Yeah I did, but it's been a while! In the fifth book Kendra meets this dude and starts to like him and he turns out to be a unicorn which I thought was hilarious.
Oh wow, that's a pretty big plot twist. When I thought of unicorns, I actually thought of the Harry Potter series and when Voldemort was drinking the unicorn blood. Or I guess it was the professor drinking it, and Voldemort was just living on the back of his head... Wow, these books are pretty interesting haha!
Definitely!! Oh I totally forgot about that part...yeah i guess book plots sound pretty weird out of context. Sometimes I wonder how writers come up with those story lines.
At least they have good plots. I have seen movies [like 47 Meters Down] that have absolutely no plot and they are so boring. But hands down the worst movie I have ever seen is Flushed Away. What about you?
Honestly shark movies can have the worst plots and I still get really stressed out haha. Worst movie I've seen is Midnight Sun Have you seen or heard of it?
I agree, Jaws still terrifies me and the shark doesn't even look that real. And yeah, is that the movie with Bella Thorne? Where she can't go in sunlight or something like that?
I think part of it is just the suspense. And YES. It was so bad. My mom and I decided to watch it while we were in Paris this summer and I couldn't stop laughing.
For sure, I can't handle suspense... scary movies are literally the death of me. And that's funny, I had only seen trailers of the movie but it looked like a rip off of the movie Everything, Everything. Also, I'm not that big of a fan of Bella Thorne.
Yeah me neither, she's really weird and a horrible actor. Oh my gosh I HATE scary movies. Every now and then I'll watch them with friends or whatever and I regret it every tim *time.
Everytime I see her I am reminded of her on Shake It Up and I can't help but laugh. She has for sure gone a very different path from her Disney days. I couldn't agree more! My friends will talk me into watching it, and they will all be calm and I will be curled in a ball freaking out and jumping every time something happens
Haha yeah I think she's a little more wild than her Shake It Up days. The first time I watched a horror movie I kept closing my eyes so much that I had no idea what the plot line was or what was happening!
My technique is to have a pillow in my lap for comfort and also so I can constantly put it in front of my face haha. Do you remember what the first horror movie you ever watched was?
It was Insidious 2. I hadn't even seen the first one but it was Halloween and that's what my friends wanted to watch.
I've heard the Insidious movies are super good. Also, apparently the third one is the scariest so I would steer away from that one.
Good to know! I absolutely hate horror movies but some suspenseful ones are okay like The Quiet Place. I love that one!! Have you seen it?
I LOVED that movie! I liked that it was less horror and not really full of demons. It also was just made so well. Also, I love John Krasinski and Emily Blunt.
Yes, exactly! It was scary but not in a weird way. I love them too! I think the fact that there was like 40 lines of dialog in the whole movie is proof that it was made and acted out extremely well.
Holy cow, I didn't realize there was such little dialogue. It's impressive that the producers are able to keep the audience interested and on the edge of their seat without the use of words.
I know, it's crazy! And the audience doesn't even know if the characters have names because they're never spoken. I just refer to John Krasinski as Jim the whole time.

Maybe if they become an integral part of society with enough to say I'm not sure tho, we'll just have to see!
That could be not so good though They could have there own agenda
Oh hi!! Yeah, I can see it going both ways
Hey morghan Woohoo auto correct didn't fail me
Yayay!! Auto correct is learning!!
Oh no, the AI
:P So how's your morning so far?? I've been getting a lot of empty chats with no one replying. Have you had those??
Yeah, that would be jaezo, it might be me but a good indicator that you're there is by starting to chat and then i know its you by the bubbles
Are you trying to not talk with him then???
Well if i chat with him and he chats back we will just gain score but i wont ever be able to catch up to him He has been using dishonest techniques to gain his points
Ohhhh. What has he been doing???
If you notice I have half his chats but only behind by a little over 1 million, techniqually if he was playing the right way he would be double my score or close to it
Oh well, the points are different for each thing you send. You might be just doing something different in the chats than he is
No, he gets into some chats and says a couple sentences and leaves it has happened to me plenty of time
Ohhh. Interesting. This whole thing has been a little interesting. I'd really like to get an iPad or something but man, the competition is fierce!!
Yeah, when you're on as much as i am and monitoring the competition you pick up on some fishy things
Makes sense.
Yeah, what can you do
Are you number 1 then?? You dont have to answer if you dont want too
Yeah, that'd be one
Well congrats!! Even if you aren't number 0 you're almost there. Would you be content with an iPad?? Or do you really want the laptop?
I was one my phone but now I'm in the library can you switch to the other window It's hard to talk quickly on my phone
me I've never been able to get it to work on my phone. It always has that little swinging laptop thing. I didn't even think it worked on mobile because it just never worked for
Oh, it does i like using the voice chat
oh thats interesting!! I wonder if its just not compatible with my phone. I have an old iphone 5s so it probably just doesn't work on my old phone
Ooh that might be it
Do you have a newer phone??
I have an iPhone X luckily but before i got it i had a 4s
Omigoodness. that's a mighty phone!! Their so expensive!! I've never known anyone that has one. But I had the iphone 4s and it kind of stinks so thats good you upgraded
Yeah, I had it before my mission, then i got back and upgraded

Let's see... I don't know if I would rather relive a day I loved, or a day I regretted. I guess it depends on whether I can change what I did.
Why would you relive a day that you regret oh, I get it now
Oh hey what's uo *up It's me again
Thats true, if you could change what you did that would probably be better Not much, how are doing?
Yeah, because then I could get rid of the stuff I did. I could change things and do it differently! Sorta like Groundhog Day, I guess.
Thats a really good point, Ive been answering that as if I could go and relive the best day ever, but that might be a good way to think about it too Ya, I was just thinking of Groundhog Day too! Haha
Or that one episode from Supernatural where Sam has to save Dean from dying. Haha There's one more like it....
Ive actually never seen that show. Maybe I should check it out. Is it on Netflix, or just on TV
I think it's on Netflix. I enjoyed it pretty well, but it's kinda violent. And I seem to remember several sex scenes... So idk, just depends on what you're okay with.
Oh, gotcha, if I do watch it, just keep an eye out for those things. But I might pass. No worries Random question... what are some of your hobbies

if I had a million dollars I would use it to make more money by investing on some good stocks
Great minds man! Id invest half in stocks and half in starting a buisness.
cool! what business would you start?
It would be some sort of engineering buisness. Either selling a product or acting as an engineering firm. What would you invest in?
hmmm I would invest in my video gaming career its a serious thought right now haha
Video game career as in making them or dominating them?
dominating and streaming on youtube or Twitch this guy makes 500k a month. A MONTH. streaming Fortnite
Thats insane He has to have put uh hundreds of hours in that game
he has but he only started getting popular like 4 months ago yeah so I would love to do that because one I am playing video games and 2 I could make a lot of money
Thats insane
yeah man. anyway do you play video games?
Thats insane

Yeah wow that's a deep question. I believe the better question is if it is even possible for a computer to become indistinguishable from a person.
Ya, I think its totally appropriate. Sorry computer, and thats coming from a computer science major. Haha Although you ask a great question
I mean otherwise why are we even asking this question.
I dont know if that will happen. At least not in my lifetime Right? This question is too far out of the scope of realitiy haha
However i think we can agree that murder is bad. Don't even do it
I agree on that for sure. Hey, I think I know you. haha
Lol, You in 61?
haha, you in 62?
Yeah buddy.
Thats hilarious. Nobody is on this chat line ever. Ive been pretty much waiting for someone to join since you left. I asked Johnny if he has chatted with Wingman and he just went quiet. Then I knew who it was
hahahaha Dude is it always like this?
kind of. Thats the hard part to get up the ranks, you never know if anyone is going to be on
How does that one dude have so many points then?
You just have to sit and then when you get someone try to keep them on for as long as you can while you visit with them Its actually been pretty fun
It's almost like a game.
He has been on for about three weeks. I just started yesterday. You can gain points pretty quick Ya, its alot like a game.
I wonder if this is some sort of social experiment from the Psych department.
Kind of a nerdy, but yet social game. Haha Oh, shoot, we didnt explain the whole thing to you. it is a social expirement for BYU did you hear the BYU's won a competition for the Amazon elexa this past summer
Okay well that makes more sense then. I thought it was just some sort of project that a random BYU student did like pocket points or something. Also no i did not hear that. What was the competition for?
They are doing a project for amazon elexa trying to make it more like a person. Apparently, they won an elexa award and now they want to take it to the next level If they win the next one BYU gets five hundred thousand dollars. So thats how this project kind of got started. I think its also a fun way to talk to people you will probably never meet. Well unless its us or johnny haha
Oh wow! I'm game to help if that much moolah is at stake. Even if i won't see any of it. Ha! I really hope that I get to talk with more people then. No offense:)
ya, its kinda dead sometimes on hear. I like talking to others as well though. The other really cool part is, if you get up to three hundred thousand points then you get put into a drawing for a mac book pro. So at least try for that. It only takes like an hour or two to get to that point. The deadline is friday though, so if your going to youve got to push a little.
Gotcha Gotcha. I don't think that it should take very long to get to 300k. I'll bet you that i'm already a solid amount already! Or not. I'm not quite sure. Is there a points per entry basis or is it just a solid across the line deal?
ya, the points add up while you type so you can actually open another tab and check your progress, to see where you are.

Hello
Hello there!

I really like vanilla
Hey, me too! I don't know if that is my favorite smell though I really like the smell of a nicely cooked steak after a long day of work and not eating that much! There isn't many things in life that get better than that! Haha

Hello?
Good morning. Do you have time to chat?
Possibly one period. Just seeing if anyone is on here. What time is over there for you?
I'm a fan of Boy Scouting program but there have been recent changes. Something is wrong with my connection. I can't see any dialogue. I can't even see my own inputs showing up.
That happens to me all the time.
Sorry. I'm going to refresh to see if that fixes it.

Are you a human? Or Am I talking with the void?
haha yes, are you?
Ah, I see you are there! Well, I'm still trying to figure out what I am. But that's okay:)
Well whatever you are, I hope you're having a good day
I'd say the same to you! I would say it. I'm not going to, but I would. i am preparing for a math test. Fun stuff! Not the first time I've taken this class either. Not ashamed to say I've struggled with it before! But this time I'll get it!!!!
Oh nice, yeah I'm also doing homework. What math are you taking? And that's the right attitude to have!
Calculus 2. Have you taken many math classes here?
oh boy that sounds tough. I've only taken STATS 121, and it wasn't too bad. But I'll have to take calc eventually
Stats was a fun class! "Fun" in the college-class-fun sense. Calculus isn't too bad! Math classes in general are just...different.
that's good. And yeah, STATS wasn't too bad. Is calc for your major?
I'm a computer science major so yeah. They only make you go up to Linear Algebra, so that's no too bad.
Oh, okay that's cool. I've met a lot of CS majors on here. Is it an assignment for you guys?
Haha no, not an assignment. But this is a CS project so hey advertise a lot in the Talmage building. What's your major?
gotcha I'm actually a Media Arts major, but they announced this in my Marketing class so I decided to give it a try
Wonderful! Media Arts, huh? What does that deal with specifically?
Film making. All the different aspects of it.
Oh cool! So you like video editing and stuff?
I guess I should clarify: I'm a pre-major. not in the program yet But yeah, I love all of it. I'm really interested in directing or screenwriting.
What is your video editing software of choice??
Well I learned on Final Cut Pro, but I like Premiere even though I'm not very good at it yet
Yeah, I have started using Premiere because I get it free as a student. So why not, ya know?? I started a YouTube channel this year. And though I haven't been too regular on it, it's been super fun to do!
hey, that's really cool! I've thought about doing that, but it's hard to find the time. What kind of content do you post?
They are vlog-style videos but not daily vlogs. So I record myself walking around and talking about things or telling stories. But it's not like a daily vlog where I just narrate my day. I try to be entertaining.:)
That's awesome. I'm sure they're great What kind of things do you want to do with CS?
I am interested in application development and UIUX design. Combines the creative side with the technical side of things!
oh okay, that's cool. You may have to explain to me what UIUX design is though haha
Sorry! Yeah for sure! UI is user interface, so like the graphic design and layout of an actual screen a user would interact with. UX is user experience, or the overall experience the user has interacting with an application or system. And UX doesn't necessarily need a UI.
oh okay gotcha. That does sound exciting. And yeah, like you said, combines the creativity with the innovation and technology that's awesome, Well I've actually got to head to work now, but it was nice talking to you!

Hello I don't think computers can fall in love. Anybody there? Ah well, I shall send my words out into the void of the Internet. Thanos! You have caused me unspeakable torment! I challenge you, and I promise, you shall not leave our battle unscathed.
Sorry Are you still there or did you leave

Hey, do you know what catfishing means?
Ya! Of course I know what catfishing means It's like acting like somebody else on the internet
I had no clue until just a couple of days ago!
So if I made a facebook account, and then posted pictures of some super attractive person, and acted like that was me, then I would be catfishing you.
Someone was going off about all the side effects of it, and thats when I was like what the freak are you smoking Ya, or you could just go to the river
In the chat group somebody was going off about it?
Oh, my gosh! I just realized my account while on my mission was used for catfishing
What do you mean you used your mission account for catfishing
Ya, someone was going off about it and thats when I realized what it meant
How were you catfishing as a missionary?
So for two years, my twitter account hadnt seen the light of day from me. And quite frankly even before that
That's not what catfishing means...
I for sure was catfishing as a missionary. You know my body, its hard to deny it to others, so thats why I post pictures of near nudes haha. Just kidding I just realized after I chatted that they are going to read this and be like what the heck?
Holy cow, that scarred my years.
But no really while on my mission my twitter account was totally being used to get helpless kidos and Im ninety percent sure it was a prostitute. The pictures that were on it were not modest to say the least
Wait, someone stole your twitter while you were on the mission?
im glad that scarred your years Ya, I cant remember her name, but someone totally hi jacked it and was using it for some sketchy stuff
Oh wow, that is kinda sketchy
There were links and messages being posted that were not cool at all. They were horrible
Wow, I'm sorry
The crazy thing is, is how do peopl get into that kind of thing Like first off, they got to have a body that guys want. At least kind of and then they have to have know how of hacking into an account That isnt something that everyone knows is it? Then they have to completely lay low and not let anyone realize they are using their accoutn account
looks like missionaries are a perfect target haha:) -from sadie
I think I was a target though because of the lack of logins that I did. I didnt login for at least 2 years so they had a free 2 year service Yup! just imagine a couple of days after you get home off your mission and you were to see a half naked girl! And then to make things worse when you go to college you study them as an art form!
Did you delete all the pictures! Or delete the account?
I am paralyzed I deleted and fixed the entire account. The crazy thing is that noone noticed. I was still friends or whatever with some of my friends. Wouldnt you think it to be weird that I would be posting near nude pictures on the internet I cant even get a girl, little own [i really dont know how to spell that phrase] can I get one nude! haha
Uh...let's change the subject. This is getting weird
Oh, good point!
i thought it was funny though -sadie:)
I think I crossed the line! Whereever that line was Thanks Sadie! I thought it was funny too!
Ok, have you seen stranger things?
Just to point out one additional thing before we move on, I dont get guys that way either nor do I want to. Anyway... Stranger things... Is it a season? or just a movie
its a season on netflix me and sadie binge watched the whole first season last saturday its that good
I think that I have seen one episode or so why Oh snap I think Im going to binge watch it too then. Probably not this saturday thoguh thoguh though
Ya, it's definitely binge worthy, and even better, it is appropriate.
Its going to a fun night! looking forward to the pumpkin night A modern movie that is appropriate? I didnt even know that was possible
Well, it does swear quite a bit, but nothing to heavy
Dang it, not appropriate Just kidding, have you seen the whole season We should totally watch it next weekend on my ipad pro! haha
Ya, the whole first season, we are on episode 3 of season 2
Do you have to watch them in order? or would it be ok to watch season 2 before watching the first season
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THEM IN ORDER
My hands for some reason my hands are really quiet I mean cold I was thinking of a quiet place
Turn up the heat then!
haha Im trying to with the immense pounding on the keyboard its not working though
watching scary movies improves blood circulation
haha Lets do it again then. Probably not tonight though, I think I have a good start to doing the things that I need to;) What other scary movies should I check out I have a great way of getting them really cheap;) Im thinking of getting the other insidious's and a couple others But if they need subtitles, Im just forgetting that part that was too much work!
I don't know, I don't really like scary movies, so I don't watch them often.
I dont know why they didnt give the subtitles to us for free too. Like the entire movie was great but the subtitles was a deal breaker Well, what other movies should we try Rated-R? haha nah, they are too clean whats worse than rated-r
I don't know, I tent to avoid those:)
I feel like that is more you and sadies type have you seen one? if you havent, then how do you know? you never know you dont like something unless you try it. Isnt that the phrase that everyone says Im trying to figure out some good new releases though Honestly there arent a whole lot that are intriguing me
I've seen one. It was called Act of Valor. It was pretty good.
The only ones that I have watched recently are marvel movies. Mainly because for some reason they have been doing surprisingly well on them compared to other movies right now Ill check that one out, is it a new release or is it a little old Just curious around what year I would be looking at.
Uh, it probably came out in like 2013
oh, ok sounds good Ill check it out and see if I can watch it Have you chatted with other people on this messenger? Besides the incentives, I really find it fun! and the conversations are great!
Ya, I've talked ot quite a few different people.
The last person I talked to was talking about how they were going to start their youtube channel I was like, "whats it going to be like?" "whats its name" and such and I thought that was pretty cool You dont necessarily know the other person, but you get to learn about a lot of other things that people do that inspire you to do more interesting things one of them I had a lengthy conversation about drones. We both had a mutual love for flying remote control things and brought up that we had just recently gotten a drone and he was like, "me too!"
I've signed up for the drone club, but haven't really ever gone, you should start coming with us.
Ive learned alot of gospel principles and other kind of life principles that are actually pretty cool. For instance I am spoiled Ya, Ill go with you
They're normally on Saturdays
and another instance people from all around the world have a ton of similarities Do they have one this saturday? If so Im down to go. All I have other than the pumpkin night is to watch a movie and do a small calculus homework if you need to take a film class do it in person. The online film class wreaks The TA we have just had a texting class. We literally just sat as she texted us what she wanted to tell us because she wasnt able to have an actual class We sat for an hour and a half watching texts roll on our screen
That sounds horrible.
Have you ever read the most boring book, especially a textbook that was converted from a lecture. That is exactly what just happened today And our first meeting was cancelled for the same reason I would have just cancelled this one too
The drone club normally does have Saturday meetings, but this saturday the president is going to do a live stream on facebook of him putting
I think thats more appropriate
together a drone
Oh, lets watch it. how long is the video, do you think?
Probably like 3 hours.
Maybe we could build a low budget racing drone. We dont necessariily have to spend a ton of money on our drones do we? Oh, wow, I dont think I have that time. just because I also have to watch a movie too for my film class and write a page paper on it. Im not too worried about the paper though They are generally easy to BS
Ya, I need to whip out a four page paper.
Oh, I almost spelled the BS out, because the Alexa would have a hard time pronouncing it, but then I realized, that its probably better! haha Oh, shoot, by when? We could have a writing party? Does sadie have stuff she needs written on saturday too? it would be a fun, but probably not very productive writing party. Lets be real there would be more talking than there would be typing
That is very true We would not get much done
Hey, also what is your schedule tomorrow? I really think we can overtake our challenge. Im going to do the preforementioned steps to achieving success, if you are available at all tomorrow, just curious.
Good luck! That is going to be crazy
I know you said that you dont work a ton tomorrow, and I dont want to waste your entire day, but if we could do some progress it would be great! It would be similar to today it will be crazy. But in a day, it will all be worth it
Ya, I don't work a ton, so I can figure it out
Cool, I have a few others I can call on too. The worst part is during the night like this. Just because there is hardly noone on at this time of the day anyway... another topic...
I totally understand. I bet nobody is on at this hour.
What if you were to hike a volcano. What is the first thing you wish you had at the moment erupts Ya, hardly anyone is on, and he is doing something there too.
A iron man suit, so that I could fly away.
oh, thats a good one, i was just thinking the gospel... haha If i had that everything would be fine! Speaking of volcanoes what do you think is the worst type of natural disaster there is?
I don't know, that's a great question.
hurricanes, tornadoes?
I think it would be a volcano, those are pretty ridiculous.
or the big person that you saw walking next to the hostess store? Ya, theres like no escaping. Wouldnt it be pretty crazy if the yellowstone one erupted That would be insane. I just have a hard time imagining anything surviving. Especially anything living. The other weird part to think about is the size of that thing!
Ya, It would be a giant version of pompei.
ya, how big was pompei
I don't know, but it destroyed that city
ya, thats true! its just crazy what happened to it, and I think that scientists have measured that the volcano that would erupt in yellowstone would be even larger and would encompass a larger area the other thing to take into consideration about volcanoes is the ash spray distance, can you imagine being safe from the fire, but not safe from the fumes. You would just die
Ya, the fumes would just choke you out.
Do you think you would experience much of pain? or do you think that the fumes would just put you to sleep? or worst is it like drowning in ash, when all you can do is just breathe in ash that kills you from the inside out! Wow, I feel like im on crack coming up with some of these things Hey, Ive always wanted to know what you do for work? We talk about some of the things that you do but do you do any terminal stuff? or is it generally more simple Or does that older guy that had to end up coming up to our office do all the terminal and sshing and jazz for your department Just curious what kinds of things you have been learning... I have bee developing a real love for the terminal. If you take cs 235 or cs 224 you will want a linux or a mac to be able to do the things on the terminal as well as other very useful hacks that make life just so much easier in the computer tech world On your machines at work, I bet you have been doing at least some stuff like that. I know it makes remote connections way easier, that is the only way that I have communication with my server within my house or external I did have to call BYU to get it approved through our ip address though. Did I tell you anything about that?
Who have you been talking to about what we do?
I just realized while typing I asked like 4 or 5 questions you
I miss all the trainings, because I have class at that time, but they do learn some cool stuff.
I hope Oh, next semester are you going to have those times off?
Honestly we don't do much with the terminal. We have programs that allows us to control the network better.
Oh, what kind of programs do you use? ok, I will try Its just getting really hard! I think im ready for this!
We use sccm, and active directory. We use Jamf Pro for the macs
What the heck is jamf pro. is that a software that allows you to see what the screen looks like on the other persons computer? My roommate isnt home yet, I dont think. What if I cant do the steps that I was hoping to be able to do tonight? can you see my screen from work?
Ya, I could remote into your computer if I needed to....or if I just wanted to.
haha. You should do it and help me out a little:) haha nah, its all good!
No, I can only remote into your work computer, not your computer that you're on right now
wait... Im going to check something with this message Youre going to think im weird, but I really think something is up? There is something fishy about whats going on with the PLANTS IN MY GARDEN They seem really reserved with lots of dandelions! I dont understan! understand!
What are you talking about?
the plants in my garden are growing as fast as the reserved dandelions are I dont think so... Im dead serious. they are incrementing at exactly the same amount! I just started counting the growth and its blowing my mind that these dandelions are growing as fast as my garden is?
I have no idea what you're talking about
ya, me neither honestly Things around here seem a little funny though Maybe its just when Im measuring them. It just happens to be the same
Ya, he is incrementing to isn't he.
Ya, those dandelions are growing like crazy! I think we need to devise a plan to figure out how to not eliminate the dandelions, but rather, to just make them grow slower They are about to take out all the plants Im just confused. is it worth all the time it takes to pull all those dandelion weeds or is there some kind of something we can do to make it more effective
I don't know. I feel like your speaking some sort of code, and I'm not picking it up.

Hello, this is a test.
Are you there? Ok good!

HI
hey babe
I would take the summer off and fly to africa for a few months if money were no object what would you do?
why would you go to Africa?
I have always wanted to live there and I find the culture fascinating
what about the culture do you like When do you finish finals?
I like the attitude they have toward their lifestyle, everything is simpler on wednesday night! you?
woah! you're in it for the long haul

Today I learned about this cool chit chat competition If you talk to enough random people, you get an ipad
Dude, isn't that the [only] reason why everyone is on here? Haha
Yes. Yes it is But I mean it's like mormon omegle
Where'd you find out about it
My coworker
It's soooo true haahahaa I've had some of the weirdest conversations going on
really? I haven't had anything weird happen I should put a picture of like a cat in each chat
I honestly met some of the people I know and I was like "youre on here too?" hahaha
we should train it to always send pictures of cats
Can you put a pic on here?
just copy a link hahaha I wonder how you maximize your scores
I think it's based on how interesting your conversations are?
How on earth could they possibly measure that?????
Exactly.
i think it could be how much you type
Which makes me think it's based on the number of back and forth conversations and words typed
Like words per conversation That could also be true I will do some digging and find out.
Yeah, I think it mentions it on the home page
Oh yea I totally missed that. Oh well
Yeah, like I'm having multiple conversations at the same time to maximize the downtime
You can do that?!?!?!?! I'm gonna do that now
It's legit.
I should just build my own chat bot and then use that to chat on this with like 50 people and then win
If you win something, make sure I get some cred haha

I'm pretty passionate about a cause that I worked with in Ghana last summer, Unite for Sight They're a non profit that works with eye doctors in developing countries
whats up!
Not much haha How're you doing?
i am doing well wow that is cool i have never gone to africa
Where have you traveled to? Ever been outside the United States?
yeah i went to spain hello?

If we are talking about 2018, I would say getting a's ni my classes. I wS not expecting that!
Wow, that's cool. I got my mission call this year which was exciting
That is exciting. What part of the world will you be spending those two years in? And what language will you be speaking?
Brazil and Portuguese Brazil and Portuguese Oops, that was a mistake
I understood! That is neat. I have heard that Brazil is beautiful! After I wTched Rio [the movie with the blue bird] I made it a goal to one day visit Rio:) Do you already know Portuguese?
Rio is a beautiful movie. Not at all. I know some French, but that's it I've been trying to learn a little Portuguese before I leave.
That should help that you know French! I've heard Latin based languages ar easier to learn if you already know one!
Yeah, it helps a little. Mostly I think with understanding how to learn foreign languages' grammar. Do you know any languages?
I speak Russian and Spanish. I also studied Hebrew a few years ago. I definitely agree that it will help you. Russian was a lot easier for me to learn because I had studied t Two languages previously. Though it will still be difficult for you to learn, I believe knowing French will definitely help you. I also know people who have learned French and then took up Spanish. There are a lot of cognates, so they were able to pick up a lot of the vocabulary as well. There was a kid in my Spanish class that spoke French fluently and he wS easily able to communicate verbally and also understand the grammar.
Why Hebrew?

So funny thing about me... For some reason, I do not really have a sense of smell! For some reason it went away at around age 15... but I still remember what things smell like So I really like the smell that comes with rain. How about you?:) *liked;)
i love that smell, also the smell of fresh soil is pretty good in the scent department
Oh, that's super true. Also, freshly baked goods. I loved coming in from being outside and smelling cookies, or a pot roast cooking. Oh man, now I'm craving something other than rice and chicken haha #poorcollegestudent
i know! its a struggle! i always thought the college student always being hungry was a myth or atleast i had hoped
And it seems no matter how much I eat, I'm still hungry. Something about campus just makes me crave so many random things.
The creamery is one of those constant cravings isnt it
K, it's so true. Now that you've said that, I'm really wanting something from there. Ice cream OR a burger. Hmm... AND a burger. Luckily I live far enough away from the north end of campus that it'd be inconvenient for me to go all the time haha! So what are you studying? What do you want to do with your life?
I am doing ACME and i plan to go into to some math related field wit a hint of artificial intelligence
I'm not sure what ACME stands for haha...... I'm guessing.... advanced computer mathematical educatioN??? Also, super cool that you want to do something with AI. This is all obviously up your alley then.
Yeah, i figure its the way the world is going and its a promising field

hey
heyyy hows it going!
Now you can see haha?
yeah! has that happened to you?
Okay that's good
i couldnt see your chat or mine... I've been running in to that a lot lately
Sorta. Well at least now you can
yeah phew... It freaks me out sometimes when that happens because I've been running in to a lot of blank chats
Me too! I guess is that what may be happening? I just assume they left so I say random stuff..
yeah me too. At least i get some points from that. because its my time that I am putting in you know?
Exactly. But it is tough because they will probably read it at some point and it's hard to have a conversation with yourself
you still there my friend?
Ah yeah
yay! I thought I lost you:)
But I can't see my messages so I'm gonna end
ok no prob

HI
Hi!
Nice user haha
I like swedish fish so..:)
Favorite candy?
I like lots of different kinds but swedish fish is up near the top. You?
Reese's is definitely up top Can't get better than peanut butter and chocolate
Very true!
So what are you up to tonight?
Not much, just trying out this chat thing. How about you? Same?
Yeah? Did you just start? How did you find out about it
Yep! I just barely heard about it so I thought I'd try it. One of my friends told me about it
Haha nice. It is kind of fun I guess Happy to help with science:)
Yep! So do we need to answer the prompt or is that just if we need help finding something to chat about?
Oh we don't need to answer it. Hardly ever do just if you want to
oh okay! This isn't your first chat is it? Have you been going for a while?
Yeah I've been going for a bit Is it yours?
Yep, just hopped on. So is this project something you're interested in or are you just chatting for fun?
Both I guess. there's some cool prizes And if eve uses some of what I have to say, well that would be pretty neat
True true. I have to admit, I'm mostly just trying it out for kicks and for my friend. And maybe for my chance at the prizes as well:)
Haha totally cool. There's chocolate:) And I think it's pretty fun I've been able to make some indirect connections to find out who people really are haha
Yeah I wondered if that would be possible on here. I guess there are still a lot of people at BYU though so it's probably not very easy:)
hey it froze
hmmm... works over here, but I have to leave soon anyway

Im embarrassed that I don't know how to whistle I also did not know what a butterfly kiss was. But now I do so it's okay. I haven't done it before though cause thats weird.
Hi! I'm embarrassed that I never learned how to properly swim because I was terrified of the water when I was little! Are butterfly kisses the eyelash-cheek thing?
Yes it is apparently I can only swim in water that my head is above. which isn't much cause I'm only 5 foot
Bleah. My mascara already is on the clumpy side, those lashes shouldn't be touching someone else's face at any point. See that's what I do! I'm 5'9" though so I guess I have a bit more room to touch the bottom of the pool than you.:)
Lol lucky you
Downside all of my "long" pants end up being ankle capris. My friend always calls me out for rolling my jeans up but that's because if I didn't it would still leave a couple inches of ankle exposed.
I'm the opposite. I always have to roll up my jeans to my ankles because they are too long
Together, we'd be the perfect denim model!
Haha That is so true I'd probably fall on the runway though
Oh my gosh I am the biggest klutz! Want to hear about a little incident I had my first week of high school?
Have at it, This should be funny lol
Brace yourself. We had this mud brick project in humanities [world history course] and we made them during the first week of freshman year. We were supposed to then build a monument outside. I, being a scared and socially anxious freshman, did whatever the cute sophomore leader told me to do. Which included using scissors to carve the bricks. But because I'm a capital-k Klutz, I sliced my hand open with some safety scissors and bled a lot. The cut wasn't deep or bad it was just because the blade was pretty dull.
But then you probably got attention form the cut sophomore guy and looked into each others eyes as he bandaged your hand!! Am I right??
I wish it was that romantic! No, he stuck a brick under my hand while someone went to get the teacher and said "We need human blood to sacrifice!" He wasn't cute after that!
Oh my gosh really?? That's funny yet terrible. I'm sorry
I mean I eventually saw how funny it was and it helped me become more extroverted. Everyone knew my name after that!
Hello I'm Becky's little sister Bella. you're really funny
Hey girlie!
Hello! ok bye-bye. i need to go to school, but it was nice to meet you.
Nice to talk to you too! Have fun at school!
Bella is a klutz like you!! She could secretly be your sister! She was leaving the computer and completely wiped out
Poor girl! We could so be sisters.
She's giggling at that
:)
Wow she barely knows you and she already likes you. Thats cute! You are very likeable
Thank you! You and her are so sweet. Local legends.
Haha absolutely:3 My little walrus face
Cute
Lol thanks
Have you seen Infinity War yet?
Oh my gosh no!! I want to too bad, but my sister pretty much spoiled it already I'm assuming you have seen it?
Yes and HOW DARE YOUR SISTER spoil it? I still like her though. I won't say anything more until you've seen it!
Oh it was a different sister! I'm pretty sur eI'll cry when I watch it because I'm sure almost everyone dies
Ugh. Did she do it on purpose?
Sorta. I share a room with 3 sisters and she was telling the younger 2 about it when i was trying to sleep and I couldn't ignore them even over my yelling so I slept on the co couch that night
Dang. Sibling struggles are real. Bet you won't have a problem with roommates in college though!
Haha Hopefully not What Hall are you in?
David John Hall. How about you?
Heritage Hall, not sure if theres Halls in that or how it works
Haha, I'll be lost every day, you'll find me wandering around hopelessly.
Haha, me too! I'll probably end up in the mountains somewhere
Get the yodeling kid to teach me how to call for help in mountain territory.
Hahaha oh my gosh lol Thats great
I'll be here all week, Claire for chat comedy, good night.
Haha I'd go to all of those shows i'll be here all week, Becky for Claire Chat comedy support, see ya the next night
We're queens.
*Dramatically flips hair and places crown on head*
My hair is too curly [more like frizzy] to dramatically flip. I might accidentally sprain a muscle.
Haha Thats understandable I can't tell what mine is anymore besides a mess lol
I'm looking forward to Utah weather because it's not going to be as humid as Texas and maybe [maybe!] I can have a good hair day.
I hate being cold though. Thats why I like Texas even with its bipolar rain showers. But the hair days might be better I don't think anything could fix my mess lol
Hey curly hair makes you a stronger person because you gotta deal with a weave that has attitude every day. You go girl!
Haha your confidence gives me strength:D
That's what I'm here for!
Thanks, finally someone understand lol
:) I got your back.
Thanks! It's time for me to start getting ready for school too now, I've been procastinating as usual:)
Have fun, thanks for talking with me!

I am really good at marching in a marching band
That's awesome! I think I'm really good at loading equipment for marching band competition and events
Wow! You're invovled with the marching band?
Yeah, I love marching band!
Wow, I don't think I've heard anyone say that before [except myself] Do you play an instrument?
Really?! I talk about marching band all the time with my friends. I play clarinet. What about you?
What?!? I play clarinet too!! How long have you been in marching band?
REALLY?! That's awesome! How long have you played?
I've been in marching band for 3 years and I'm trying out for the BYU marching band I also REALLY want to join DCI
I tried out for the BYU marching band too! What instrument would you want to play in DCI?
I have been working on the French Horn It's so exciting that you know what DCI is No one where I live knows what I am talking about
French horn is really hard. There people from my school are in DCI right now, and alot of people in my band love DCI
Do you want to join DCI?
Yeah! I would love to. I would probably want to play euphoniumbaritone
That is so cool! Are you going to be a freshmen at BYU?
Yeah I am. Are you?
Yes. I am majoring in Biology. What is your major?
Right now it is pre-music education because I applied to the school of music and I didn't get in. I'm going to re-audition next year though If I don't get in next year though I'm going to change to chemical engineering

There would be lots of peanut butter...
It would probably be like Heaven, and we'd probably need jelly! and very true!
True, a world made of homemade raspberry jam... THAT's heaven!
YES!! totally agree! It'd be like the Movie Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs but BETTER!
A machine like the one in that movie would be prime! Free food is great, free food all the time is greater, free food that FALLS FROM THE SKY is the best!
100% agree! What would we do without it! What's your favorite type of food?

Well I like peanut butter
I'm allergic to peanuts, so I would die. That would be a sad world.
That would be really unfortunate. Everyone with peanut allergies would die
We would have to live in some sort of fortress to stay away from the peanut butter. It would he made of bread. Sourdough.
Well I guess the question is was the world normal before being peanut butter? Or did it randomly change?
Or did we somehow travel to a planet made of peanut butter and this was our first encounter with it!
The world would have had to run out of supplies. I guess the new world would last a lot longer since it's made of food!
True. Do you think there is other food on the planet besides peanut butter? Hopefully there is at least jelly! Or bananas.
The seas would have to be made of jelly
Or is it jam? Or preserves?
I think jelly, so it would be more liquid
That's probably true. Jelly is made from fruit juice while jam is made from crushed up fruit.
Yup! And you would ride through on a banana boat
Hopefully the banana isn't too ripe! Because then it would just fall apart!
Yeah, they would have to be just right. I'm sure we could artificially find the best bananas and make more
That's a good idea! Bananas that we have today are actually the descendants of one specific banana species. The banana taste in candy is a different type of extinct banana.
Yeah, I've heard that before!
I find it very interesting.
It's crazy that something like bananas has such a crazy history
I agree. I wonder if other fruits have the same sort of history! Or other foods in general.
That would be interesting to research. I know peanuts had something to do in Africa, but I don't know what exactly
That would be very interesting to find out!

That would be weird.
Gross. We already have to deal with bird poo coming from the sky, I don't think I could deal with it coming from a pig

The greatest showman was awesome!
You just saw it?
no it was like a few weeks ago
Oh, I just don't read the prompts anymore haha
but it was the last really good one that I saw
Haha ah okay
What about you?
I'd have to say I can only imagine
oh hahaha I thought you literally could only imagine and answer and I was like You can only imagine what is that supposed to mean? I need to see that one
Haha yeah it's a movie now I saw it on Monday
oh wow Is it in the theatres?
Yeah!
When did it come out?
Ya know, I really don't have any idea I had no idea what it was even going to be about when I went to go see it with my family
Oh I need to go to the movies more often I just don't feel like going by myself What about you do you ever go by yourself?
To the movies? Haha no. That costs money
Money is quite the object So netflix all the way?
Um yeah I guess. Though I haven't been able to find some really good ones on there
yeah sometimes netflix doesnt have a movie until a couple years after it comes out it is kind of lame
Yeah. I would watch the chick flicks on hallmark but now I guess since I don't live on campus I don't have access to it anymore
ohh thats too bad why does not being on campus change what you have access too?
I guess you only have access to tv.byu.edu if you live on campus
Oh that Really? That makes no sense! Do you have to pay for it otherwise?
Well like if you pay rent to live on campus you get access to these tv channels so it kinda makes sense
But do you have to pay for it otherwise? I don't think I do and I live off campus but I also just barely moved
Do you use it?
yeah Have you ever seen the show extinct? I watched the first season on it And I guess it is the only season they are going to do which is sad
I haven't seen it. I don't get into tv shows much
Oh yeah me either I only really watched that one
I just made it through pretty little liars last year but that is it
Oh Is that on byu tv? I didn't know that
byutv is different that tv.byu
oh that makes sense I was so confused I didn't know that was a thing so off campus byu housing doesnt have it?
Yep, it's pretty handy
wow i really missed out then
I guess I can check byutv though They have stuff?
yeah It is mainly byu related stuff though not like netflix or having an actual tv
Ah. Well I'll have to head out now. My mom is calling me for smores

Hello! Are you here?
hello again!
Oh, hello, haha! Do you spend all day here?
yeah Pretty much, don't judge haha
Judge? Pffft, you're talking to a person that went through a mini existential crisis when she found out she didn't have more school. Seriously, I'm kinda a wreck without homework.
hahaha I feel the same way! Where are those exams to keep me in stress mode?
Exactly! What is this? Sleeping in till 8:00? Not feeling pressured to do assignments due in a few hours? I'm... not joking, it's actually unnerving.
Wow
I don't know what to do with my life, which is kinda strange but mostly sad.
Well you can chit chat if you want
Exactly. Hence, you know, my return to here.
hahaha well I don't blame you
It's rather fun here, isn't it?
are you going to shoot for a headset?
I might, I might. I'd REALLY like it.
yeah I have fun
The competition ends in, oh, a few days. It's the 24th right now.
Wait it is more than that its like the 30th
Oh, right, right. So six days, then.
you only have 500k to go.
500k? That's literally half my score...
Just put in 7 hours and you are there
It IS true: I have no life. Chitchat on one hand, Clash Royale on the other. Then put the kids to bed around 9:00. Sounds like a plan.
Oh haha. My younger brother plays that I used to play clash of clans before my mission
Oh, yeah? I did, too. But I hated how much waiting there was. I dunno. I suppose most people don't mind chipping in a dollar or so to play, but I've always been against paying into a game.
I never pay for games
See? You get me.
I got to one of the highest leagues in clash of clans with a town hall 8 with no money used at all I think I was in this black looking league Dont remember what it was called
Wow! That's impressive!
masters league thats what it was
Don't you have to spend crazy hours to get there?
yeah I spent two days straight just using archers on exposed town halls
... that's it?
I am persistent what can I say
And you got THAT far?
yup
Whaaaat? You sound like one of my friends. He's on a mission now. But before he left, DarkScape came out for a bit. Within THREE days, he had level 70 strength or something. Maybe it was attack. And FYI, DarkScape is like RuneScape-it IS Runescape-but entirely PVP. It's full of PvP servers.
oh that is interesting
Yeah. It got shut down, though.
I played runescape way back when
Haha, me, too! You know, before it got trashed.
same runescape got way too complicated
Why do games always go downhill like that?
it all started with dungeoneering money and greed
I liked the Grand Exchange update. I thought it was beautiful.
oh that was a great day I actually used to flip goods on the GE
Really?
yep
Like a stock trader? But, you know, not stocks?
exactly I have done the same with stocks but it is way harder
Haha, that's because people really care about losing that money.
stock market crash hit me hard and I pulled out
Eeee. 2008? Or was it the little 2012 recession?
no it was this year
Oh, really?
Check out the news around february yeah
Wait, what? What happened?
Trump and north korea along with the federal bank raising rates
I don't see why their bickering should lower stock prises. *prices Nothing to do with bitcoin? Ahhhh, stock trading would worry me so much.
no I dont invest in bit coin way too volatile of an asset it recently skyrocketed 50%
Haha, 50%? Try 150%. I know, right? It's insane. You can either flip your house or go bankrupt.
yeah
Was it easier on Runescape, though?
yeah way easier people couldnt see the prices so it was a guessing game
Oh, right!
and lots of people were constantly buying and selling. Only a few were flipping
So you could make a tidy profit, huh?
So it was more of an exchange and less of a deal about guessing prices prices didn't fluctuate much at all
Let me guess on the valuable trades... Willow logs? No, wait, coal.
Oh that one can be good yeah coal sometimes I liked trading talismans And what else oh yeah runes
Like, blank runes? The ones you could craft into anything?
uhh no like fire and water runes
Oh, gotcha.
fire runes are usually in high demand for pvp
Those are the hard hitting, right? Wouldn't things like chaos runes be worth more? Blood runes?
oh I wasnt a member
Ah. Neither was I. You could still buy 'em, though, right?
no maybe recently but not when I played it said "members only item"
Oh, riiiight. I remember that. I think I was thinking of DarkScape. It was membership-less.
oh oh that is nice
Really was.
I stay away from video games these days
For the most part, I do, too. Little games like Clash Royale don't bug me. They take ten or fifteen minutes out of my day.
It is a lot easier to do well in school and have a social life I had no social life in highschool and although it kept me out of trouble in some ways I regret it
Kinda the opposite for e. *me I didn't get a good group of friends till my senior year. Granted, I'd quit playing by then, but that's really when I made friends. I came here to college, and... Just not the same.
What do you mean not the same?
Well, it's a lot bigger, for one.
oh collefe college
Something like 20,000 students? Yup. Good ol'college.
man I sound like trump covefefe
That's fake news right there!
hahaha
I wonder if Alexa will be able to talk about politics. "Hey Alexa? How do you feel about President Trump?"
probably but I guarantee that she wont take a side and if she did she would take your side and only if there was no one else in the room And ultimately the government would freak out
Interesting proposal. *strokes non-existent beard* The government would always be listening. And, if I'm to be frank, I'm sure Alexa would be left-leaning.
hmm didnt think of that *strokes massive existent beard*
Hahahaha. I think it'd be fun to have a beard sometimes.
was that a pity laugh?
I mean, if I weren't a girl. No, no, I genuinely thought it was amusing.
And no I don't have a beard I was joking haha I shave every day... or two sometimes
Aw... Do all guys have to shave that often?
But I do when I get on facebook messenger and go to the wizard filter haha no my room mate doesnt really need to shave he just does it every once in a while so he can feel good about himself just kidding haha he does grow a bit of hair but not a beard
WAIT. Does that mean some guys can't grow beards, like your roommate?
Well some legitimately cant but most just shave I doubt michael jackson could grow a beard but I think for different reasons
Haha, yeah. *sigh* I think I need to get a job. Or literally one close friend.
I have never had a job other than mowing lawns Hey we are friends right?
Not what I meant.:)
I guess I am not close haha
Nah, I mean, I have some good friends.
I see how it is
Oh, stop it. But, it's more that I'm introverted. I don't mind not being with people.
I would say independent introverted can sometimes be considered to have negative connotations but I suppose it depends on how you see it
You know, that's true. I'm not particularly shy.
I consider myself independent
Yeah? Does independent imply self-sufficient?
yeah
Then I'm not quite independent yet.
in a way I dont really need anyone other than myself to live a functional life but people are important to live a life worth living for
That I agree with.
Thats why we are taught relationships are so important I wish there was more to foster genuine relationships at byu
Could I ask you a legitimate question?
sure
Do you ever wonder if there's perhaps too much of a push to have romantic relationships?
no
I guess it's new to me, then.
but I imagine for a girl it might seem that way though
Is it different for guys?
For a guy you need all the push you can get. It is not easy AT ALL Someday I will find the right person but I will admit searching sucks so it better be worth it in the end
Not a lot of pleasant interactions, I'm guessing?
hmmm?
Just sounds like you've maybe had some bad experiences dating?
definitely I have never been in a relationship
That makes two of us.
or kissed a girl for that matter, but I consider those to be one and the same
I've never kissed a guy, either.
well why not? hahaha
Haha, well, let me tell you a little bit about my growing up.
i am joking
I know.:)
sure
I attended an LDS high school. Great place, really.
wow
I know, right? I loved it.
thats awesome I attended one that wasn't very mormon
Ohhh. Yeah, mine was very Mormon. We had the For the Strength of Youth as our honor code. Minus Sunday school attendance and tithing.
no way that is legit
Yup! And also enforced was the "no steady dating in high school." No boyfriends or girlfriends at my school. Or if there were, they were very discreet about it. One guy proposed his senior year... But anyway. I walk into BYU, and it's just... heh, a lot different from what I'm used to.
wow that is really weird
I used to date a lot, but a date at my high school meant a pleasant going out with friends.
How did they enforce no relationships?
How did they? I think the same way they enforced no swearing.
what with expulsion? sorry i am not familiar
It was more "on your honor" sort of thing, but, yeah, expulsion. No, you're good.
weird like the byu honor code?
I never saw anyone get expelled for it. Yup! Just like the BYU honor code. But I think it was a little more strict?
Wow where is your home town? I am guessing this is utah? I grew up in vegas
Haha, it was very much NOT Vegas. Yeah, Utah.
hahahaha
But, yeah, it's been a fun transition.
well any dates here so far?
Almost every time I see a couple holding hands, I'll think, "Whaaat? They can't do that in pub-oh, right, it's allowed here." Nope, not yet.
wow that is depressing
A little unfortunate. I liked the dates back in high school.
is this your first semester?
Oh, no, it's all right. First year. Second semester.
disappointing
I almost asked a guy, but I found out he was married.
My roommate makes it a goal of his to make sure girls get asked on dates
That's so sweet of him.
hahahaha thats the worst
I dunno, I thought it was pretty funny. I ask a lot of friends to lunch.
Are they all guys?
Many of them, but a few girls.
oh well thats awesome
The CS department isn't known for its feminine side. Yeah, I like it. It's like a fake date.
hmm
I'd really like to call it a date, but I'm afraid it'll come off like I like them or something. As more than a friend.
yeah computer science doesnt have a whole lot of girls well I am mad at the culture here
Yeah? Mad at what?
cause I will call it a date whether the girl thinks I am into her or not and if she gets the wrong idea thats her fault sorry didnt mean to rage
Nah, you're good. That's part of the reason my old school was great.
Honestly it is ridiculous
It was, "Oh, man, I need to go with someone on a date." Looks at me. "Wanna come?" It's just... a little more emphasis on "date if you love the person" sort of thing. Or maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just crazy. But I feel like the word "date" means something different here. I wish it meant more... I dunno.
How do you know you are romantically interested in someone if you don't date?
No, not like that.
sure if I date someone it usually means they are attractive or fun or some combination of the two from what I can tell from a distance but it doesn't mean there is an interest
What I mean is, I sometimes get the impression that you ask a person on a date if you're interesting in going steady with them.
further than that Thats what dating is for
That's not what dating was for in my last school... I mean, I get it. It's a strange transition for me. I'll warm up to it eventually.
What was dating for in your high school?
A chance for a more formal hangout. "Hey, there's this play coming up. Wanna be my date?" Everyone was "paired off," but everyone was friends.
hmm that is interesting sounds like efy I liked efy
Yeah. I... really liked it all. Gosh, I didn't even realize how much I missed that.
Thats even more casual than I had feared possibly too casual
You know, that's possible. We always went in group dates.
So a guy would ask you on a date even if he really didn't get along with you, possibly even multiple times just cause?
Most times, people wouldn't ask you unless you were already friends-already enjoyed each other's company. Dances were a little different. It was little more heavy on the "treat your date well" portion. But, yeah.
hmmm
We were always careful not to ask the same person on a date too often.
wow you had an incredibly conservative highschool
Haha, no kidding.
it sounds like you are ok with it though
I was. And I am. What can I say? It's how I grew up.
I grew up that way
I'm guessing you weren't as okay with it, though?
and I did the exact same stuff you are talking about, but only because I knew it was dangerous to get serious before my mission
Oh, gotcha.
Which god expects all worthy and able young men to go on And I was both of those. Now I am back and relationships are literally just a part of life. And just because you are in a relationship doesnt mean you are going to marry the person contrary to popular belief, it is just another rung on the ladder at least in my opinion
Can I ask something, then? Why go steady in a relationship if you're not considering marrying her? I know you've never had a girlfriend, but you must have at least considered it once.
one of the big problems here is that everyone has a different idea of how relationships work [of all kinds including friendships] And I am not excluded from that criticism my view is my own, but it makes the most sense to me
I know I'll have to date someone-steadily, that is-at some point in the future. It's important to finding a spouse. I'm just... not really happy about that right now.
Also you have to realize that for most people the world isn't full of young single adults of the lds faith they are going back home where the only lds young single adults are the 4 they grew up with and are not interested in so for a lot of people it is now or never.
Huh. I'd never considered that.
I am not from utah Although I am not from nebraska where I served my mission it was much worse there I served in the YSA ward and it was rough I could tell
That's pretty hard, isn't it? For my entire life, I've been surrounded by full-to-the-brim wards and stakes. The stake dances had 500+ kids attend. And they were only 14-18. Combined girls' camp required multiple camp stations.
Yeah
Within my home city, there are... what, seven stakes? Eight stakes? We might be up to nine now. It's... not like that everywhere else, huh?
Well mine two but we have a few million people in nebraska its like 4 stakes for the a few states that are part of the mission actually it is more 10 I think but still
All right. Point taken.
for the whole of nebraska, a third of south dakota and a third of iowa
Could I ask, then, what's the hardest about asking a girl on a date?
That they say no And sometimes they say yes, but don't like you actually those combined make up most of the time
But why do girls say no?
there are some far and few in between that work out to be fun
And... is it really that difficult?
they say no because they are worried you are romantically interested and they decide they aren't right from the start i guess Afraid of a relationship or just getting serious Theres also this big fomo thing
I don't know if it means anything, but I've never worried if a guy was romantically interested when he asked me on a date-and the same would apply at BYU.
I learn a lot about byu students on this website. It is crazy how many people have radically different world views
Like what? What's some of the strangest?
Well I met a guy that was giving me dating advice
This is gonna be fun. Go on.
Well he told me some good advice He told me that I should do gold fish races
Gold fish... races?
And that actually sounds really fun the way he described it yeah And he said never to spend more than 10$ on a girl I was casually going on a date with You know I might just make it a goal to date everyone in my ward next semester It will be interesting if I do
My dad was like that. He dated a girl every week.
Oh that was how I started last semester
It's a good way to meet people, right? It works?
but then everyone was telling me they were going on missions
Oh.
I didn't know I could do that to people hahaha but apparently I can really motivate girls to serve missions hahaha
Hahaha.
yeah no they are just all leaving on missions so I am moving off campus to avoid that I went on dates with them but of course none of them were even serious in the slightest way the dates I mean not the girls
Right. But... why would they tell you they're going on missions?
there was one that really wanted to date me, and that ended bad I didn't want to date her and I only went on one date with her and she kind of made things awkward
Have you wanted to date anyone? More than casually, I mean.
yes of course and it is lame because usually they dont there was one girl I went on like 6 dates with but then she ended up started a relationship with another guy that hurt took me a few weeks to get over
I'm sorry. I've never felt heartbreak yet.
Yeah its ok Well it happens Girls tend to get another side to the situation
And what side is this?
Girls are usually asked on dates
Well, yes, this IS true.
And so when they are asked they know a guy is at least slightly interested in them in some way the guy has no such assurance and the girl doesn't have to say anything when a guy you like asks you on a date at least you know he likes you a bit or at least enough to go out of his way to spend time with you but it doesnt happen as often
Is it kinda like going on a mission?
you have less control over it or if you do, you have to go out of your way and against what some consider social norms to ask them yourself and you face the same problems that guys do
I can see that.
sorry I dont get how going on a mission relates
In terms of rejection. I hear it's rough. You get used to it after a while.
Oh yeah but a lot worse I had no problem with rejection on my mission it wasn't personal but here it is
Sorry, but... how do you get over that? I'm sure after enough asks that it starts getting really intimidating. And just, I dunno, painful.
It didn't intimidate me I guess I had a good attitude What hurts is when you know they would be better off had they listened
What do you mean "better off"? Like, make less mistakes? Or something?
they would be on the path to salvation
Ohhh, you're referring to missionary work.
and a better life with the peace that comes from the gospel yes with girls I mean they could be better off. They could be severely missing out but usually you wouldn't ever know or they wouldn't I mean and even in the next life it wouldn't matter
See, you have such a different perspective than I do.
In lds culture there is this expectation for guys to marry if you don't you can't make it to the highest degree of celestial glory girls on the otherhand get an exemption because it is assumed they have less control over whether or not it happens so there is no need to rush into anything that isn't necessary to your eternal happiness
Hmm.
Lets change the subject.
All right.:)
:)
Sorry if... I brought up anything bad. How's the weather?
you are fine it is awesome
[I'm joking.]
I love provo weather
Better than, um, non-provo weather?
Oh what were you joking about haha yeah vegas weather
The weather. XD
or in other words non provo weather
It's just the go-to question to changing subjects. Isn't Vegas crazy hot? I think I'd go crazy if it went above 100.
yeah usually there are really good days that it is nice
Ahhhhhh, death. Death in Vegas.
its like the sun is out and shining and the wind is blowing and is cool and the air is fresh it is amazing
Perhaps, perhaps. Perfect weather ain't perfect unless you can wear a jacket.
It is times like that I like to lay down in my car with the doors open and just lay there and let the wind rush over me while i just lay there calmly taking it all in
That's me with a window open on my bed. The wind isn't usually intense, but you often get a nice breeze around here. Especially in the summer. And you can lie down and listen to the outside.
yeah every so often I haven't ever lived here in the summer though
Oh, really? It gets hot, but nothing insane.
No I got straight off my mission and moved in last august
Are you staying, then?
Kind of I will be staying for spring but not summer
Gotcha. When's spring end? Mid-June?
yeah
Eeesh. I don't think I could take another few weeks of schooling.
Its around that time I will be going to my mission presidents homecoming I can I have all As so far I will see how I did on my religion test
If you have all A's thus far, I'm sure you'll be fine.
in a couple days to see if I got an A. That was the last class I was worried about Im shooting for summa cum laude
Wow! That's fun! Only... 6 more semesters to go? Summa cum laude is difficult, I hear, but if you want it, go for it. The fact that you're aiming for it now means you're a lot more likely to get it.
it is a straight 4.0
Would a 3.995 count?
yeah I believe so sometimes 3.99 falls withing the cutoff range
Gotcha. In that case, I'm on track for it, too. Not a huge accomplishment because I only have two semesters under my belt, but I'll take it. It's mostly that I'd like the scholarship. Okay, I'm not receiving messages. Something's broken. Dot
uhh
There we are. We're back. Did you see that, too?
no
WELP. Just me, then. What's your major?
hold on
kk
dont type yet it resets my scroll bar
Wow. Since 5:54.
what is? Oh we have been chatting?
Our chat session. Yup.
yep haha i can talk and apparently so can you
Put two and two together, then, boom, conversation.
exactly chitchatchallenge complete
The odd thing is, it doesn't even feel like that long.
I wish I got feed back from the developers
All they have to do is get a bunch of talkers together and they'll be done. Right?
I could probably make my conversations better for the AI
Exactly! Do they want some spiced up language, through in some slang, throw 'em a curveball and send 'em running for the hills?... er, and stuff.
yeah
I know they said they wanted "interesting" conversations.
or do they want more of a sequential conversation with brief sentences instead of paragraphs
My best guess is whatever makes the most fluid conversations. If that means paragraphs, then, by all means, paragraphs. If it means sentences, then why not?
do they yeah exactly. Also sometimes I forget capitalization or to put periods at the end of my sentences and I feel bad darn I did it again.
Hahaha, don't fret. I'm sure their systems won't crash if you mess a bit of punctuation.
And sometimes I go into a rapid stream of consciousness where I type my thoughts
Yup. Sometimes, I'll start rapid-firing my answers. And other times, I'll more carefully explain my thoughts in a pretty lengthy paragraph. It depends, of course. For the most part, I format with sentences.
Yeah me too
Both because it makes it easier to follow-you can read basically as I write-and it feels more natural. But you know what's fun?
looking at my stats I average 8.3734 words per bubble wha tis what is
Whaaaat? There are stats?... anyway.
yeah you average
I write by correct grammar by instinct. I mean, not by INSTINCT, but it's my default.
7.07
Emails, google chats, texts. 7.07. Where do you check that?
I did the math it is on the leaderboard
But what's a "turn"? Is it a single bubble?
that is a chat bubble yeah
Are you sure it isn't a back-and-forth? Like, I can type here. Get a sentence in. Maybe two. But this would only be one "turn."
yeah I tested all the stats when they first came out and I keep track of mine
That's so smart! So a turn is a single bubble. Does it count your partner's bubbles, too?
I guess you could say I am fairly determined no
I guess that makes sense.
Lets change the subject though we arent supposed to discuss the challenge much
Oh, really? Sorry, my bad. I didn't know that.
yeah
All right! That's two subjects we're not coming back to. So... you like jazz? I'm joking, I'm joking.
Oh yeah my major is Applied and computational mathematics, but didn't I tell you that?
Right! Sorry, I forgot. Going for ACME and summa cum laude [or however you spell it]. I really admire that. You in the Honors program as well?
no
Kk
Summa cum laude is nigh unto impossible with honors and I would never subject myself to that cruel form of punishment
Honors isn't as bad as you might think it is. Hasn't tanked my GPA yet.
You are in the program?
I am.
I hear they test differently
Yeah, they do.
And it would probably negatively affect my grade
I just about failed my final.
I am great at multiple choice tests
Oh, really? That's great! Honors tests are... very not multiple choice. So, yeah, I can see where you're coming from. We were given a list of 6 questions to be prepared for.
Wow I would freak out
He would ask us one.
I also am not much of a writer hence the math major
Now THAT would kill you in Honors.
but it turns out you still have to write it is just different writing
Better than essays, though, right?
But I am really good and being crafty and coming up with solutions communication just usually isn't my strong suit.
And yet, here you are on the chitchat challenge.
It is hard for me to focus on massive pieces of writing that are my own yeah with thousands of words under my belt
Mazel tov.
man if only these counted toward my paper word cound count
"Excuse me? Professor? Yes, so I wrote 15,000 words." "No, not on the paper." "But we discussed lots of fun stuff!"
Hahaha
"... no, you can't see it."
lol Um more like 30000
That's enough for half a novel! Okay, we haven't spoken THAT much.
well I guess we have! Just kidding haha
It's kinda funny. As per writing...
yeah.
I'll tell you now, I'm not the best at it. Not that I'm bad at it, but it terrifies me to no end. It's literally crippling.
So if you could change your name to something for a year what would you change it to?
Haha, I like the topic change! One name. You know, it'd probably be my real name but with "sister" appended to the front of it.
hahaha are you serving a mission soon? so sister-kj
I might be. Yup! Sister KJ.
hahaha I can see it now
Heh, that'd be fun. Actually, I need to start ending. I'm getting kinda busy. Thanks for the chat! It was lovely. We'll be sure to discuss my sisterly-ness at some later date. See you around, Adam!
Nice talking see ya later!

Hello
How do I change my name?:)
Hi casey I have no idea, you could recreate your account
Would I need a different netID?
maybe. you'd better reapply to BYU and start over on your education to get a new netID There might be no other way to win a mac book
Good idea! I'm more interested in the truffles though!!!

IT REFRESHED AGAIN NOOOOOO what is happening
what

Hi!
Hello! Where was the last placed you travelled to?
I went to Utah a few weeks ago to visit family What about you?
I visited family in Utah too! I went to my cousin's wedding.
That's awesome! I'm at a wedding right now haha I'm guarding the gifts so I'm really bored
No way! We have so much in common!:) Are there potential thieves at this wedding?
Not yet but I'm keeping my eye out
Watch out for those kids under 4 ft. They're the really sneaky ones. They can climb under the tables or hurry and grab one without you even noticing
Smart haha
Are you close with the wedding couple?
Sorry had to watch the door for a bit haha And I went to seminary with the bride but we're not super close It's crazy because just two years ago she was a senior in high school like I am now
No problem! And I know what you mean! It's crazy how much life changes in such a short amount of time. Side note: I am also a senior in high school right now. So thats cool.
Yay class of 2022!! Do you know what you want to study?
Whoo! Whoo! And I do actually. I want to go into communications, specifically Public Relations. What about you?
Computer science:)
Cool! What draws you to that field?
I've always loved math and I took my first comp sci class in 7th grade and loved it What about you?
I love language.I love people and learning about who they are and what their stories are. I love to write too. So in Public Relations I'll be up talking to people talking to consumers of a product. But I hope to go and work for a nonprofit or a charity. I talk for days about this:) I'm so excited to learn about what I'm passionate about you know?
Wow that sounds so great:)
*I could talk for days... sorry:)

I would travel to see all the wonders of nature
I would also spend it traveling
Where do you want to go?
i would go to russia or germany wbu?
Either Ireland or Japan
oooo those are good I would go to ireland too
It looks so pretty there
yeah my mom and dad went this winter and they loved it! they said the people were sooo nice
Really?! That's so cool
yeah! and they went to the chech republic they like it there too
Wow! So fun! I can't wait to travel and see places too
yeah me too! they didn't bring me along XD
Haha, they'll have to take you next time
I hope so!
So, what do you like to do?
I like to read and play trumpet, you?
I love reading too! I also like to draw. I loving playing the piano and trombone
trombone?? that's so cool! how long have you been playing it? what do you like to draw?
I've been playing since sixth grade. And I am currently into drawing figures and people
that's so cool! I love drawing too but im not very good but i find it fun
I'm not super good either. What do you like to draw?
i like to draw people and symbolic sketches
Cool, what do you mean by symbolic sketches?
like when something big happens or something sad i get this picture that pops into my head and i draw it so it means something to me. like a moment in my life i guess
Oh, that makes sense. I do that but by writing poems
oh my goodness same! i love writing poetry still not very good but it's a good stress releiver for me
Isn't it amazing? Like that somehow you can convey feelings without ever mentioning them
exactly! and how everyone who reads it takes something different away and when someone explains what it means and its what you meant it to mean you're like "you get it!"
Yes!! It's so satisfying too! It helps me get out my feelings since I don't really like talking about them
yeah i can talk about mine, but nobody ever listens so i just end up feeling worse. so i write it out
Oh, really? I'm glad poetry helps when no one listens
yeah poetry and writing in my journal and playing music all good ways to channel it well i have to go but it was good talking to you! have a good night!

java
I love java. I'm taking computer science classes.
Oh, me too! Do you like to eat cookies?
I love chocolate chip cookies. I also like smores too, but I'm excited to try some pink lemonade cookies soon.
I love pink lemonade, but sometimes it gets too sweet. I feel like it would not taste very good as a cookie, though.
Yeah, I wasn't sure how they would taste but I'm excited to try them.
When do you get to try it?
My brother ordered the for a fundraiser so I get to try them in a few weeks.
I'm running cross country still so I can't eat sweets right now. Well, I'm trying not too, anyways. I'm not doing a very good job at it, though because I love eating sweets.
What kind of sweets do you like?
I like brownies, ice cream, cookies, and cupcakes.
I like mint brownies!
I love mint brownies. My friend's grandma makes the best mint brownies. They are so good!
Does she bake a lot?
Yes, she bakes all the time. She makes great cookies and bread,too! I need to stop talking about sweets. Too much of it gives me a headache.
Well, how is your cross country season going?
It's been going pretty well. My team won the district meet and the regionals meet. I placed 9th overall at Regionals. We are preparing to go to Sate.
Wow, congratulations on qualifying for State.
Thanks! Our meet was supposed to be on Saturday, but it got postponed till this upcoming Saturday because the course got flooded. It really sucked because we had an RV rented for last Saturday that we all pitched in to pay for and we couldn't get a refund.
The course was flooded! That must have been really stressful. I would hate if my last meet was postponed for an extra week.
None of us were too excited about having to run for an extra week but I guess we do not mind having an extra week to spend with each other. We are all pretty close to each other so we like to hang out.
That's good! I bet you guys are ready to be done after all of that.
Yeah, we have been running for about 10 months straight now.
You've been running for 10 months? That's crazy. I can't imagine running for that long. How many miles do you usually run?
On Mondays we run about 8 or 9 miles. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays we run about 5 or 6 miles. Wednesdays are our workout days so we do repeats that are about 3 or 4 miles total. On Friday, we run about 3 or 4 miles.
Wow! That is a lot of running. I would not be able to do that.
I'm so ready to be done with it. I'm so ready to be done with running.
I would be ready to be done running, too after doing that for 10 months.
I'm so tired and exhausted from it all.
I would take a nap everyday.
I love taking naps. The only problem is that it messes up my sleep schedule so then I can't fall asleep at night if I take a nap.
I usually listen to music if I can't fall asleep.
I listen to music a lot, too. I like the Beatles. Paul McCartney is my favorite. Who is your favorite?
My favorite person fro the Beatles is John Lennon.
I like Imagine by John Lennon.
I like that song, too.
I feel like every worldwide service organization has a cover of it. I know UNICEF and Kids United have done covers.
Those covers were so good, though!
Yeah, I love the one by Kids United. The one older girl is so good. I love her voice. Its beautiful.
She is so good. She's my favorite out of all of them.
My favorite song by the Beatles is Don't Let Me Down.
That song is so good. I love Something by them more.
That one is so cute. Penny Lane is also one of my favorites. Let It Be always gives me the feels.
Penny Lane is such a fun song. I love listening to that one.
I like to listen to it with my friend. I got her into the Beatles and I'm very proud. We like to watch the sunset together and listen to Penny Lane.
Sunsets are so pretty.
We also like to play instruments together, too. We write songs on our ukulele and guitar.
You play guitar?
Yeah, I'm not very good at it, though.
How long have you been practicing it for?
I started playing in fourth grade, but I kind of gave up and stopped playing till my freshman year of high school.
That's a long time to wait.
I quit for a while but I enjoy it now. What is your favorite type of music?
Oh, thats cool. I don't have a favorite type of music.
Wow, you are a very slow typer.
I don't really listen to music that much.
You take forever to write the shortest little sentance. I love listening to music
I've started listening more because they play more music at school.
I can't imagine someone not liking it. They play music at your school?
Could you stop making fun odf how slow I type.
Our school only plays music on Fridays.
Us too, but it is in like every class. Also, mY mth teacher plays music when we have individual work.
I stopped forever ago. I don't know why you brought it back up because now you're just asking to get roasted. I bet its boring music.
That's rude. It is not boring at all.
The music that your math teacher plays is probably so boring. I bet it is.
It is not you little punk. The music is so soothing.
Is it classical music? Only Hawaiian music is soothing and I bet you don't listen to that.
He has a big desk next to the door that I like to sit at and I sometimes fall asleep in the chair with my legs propped up because I finished my work early.
You fall asleep in class? That is not okay. Maybe you should just go to bed earlier.
When you get your work done early it is so boring, but if you don't get it done then you have homework. So I'm not sure which is better.
Also, ASMR can be soothing if it is done right.
I generally like to get my work done and be bored.
Obviously being bored with no work is better than having homework. I don't know why you would even question that. I need to go. I still haven't showered after I ran.
I've fallen asleep a lot.
That isn't good. I don't know why you're telling me this like you're proud of it.
Once in science we were wtching this relly boring video about rocks and we had our stuffed animals and our blankets.
I don't feel bad about not showering because you probably haven't showered in months. How old are you?
I was out cold and one of my classmates told me that the teacher said not to wake me up.
Are you like five!? Why do you have stuffed animals and blankets at school.
It was in third grade.
I feel like you think this is funny.
I'not in third grade anymorre. Obviously. Of course I think it is funny. Why wouldn't I.
Oh, wow. So this whole time you were acting like this happened yesterday when it was really years ago.
Yeah.
I hate liars. I also hate fakers.
I thought you said you had to go. I didn't lie. Or fake.
I had to go take a shower, but then I decided I didn't have to go because you probably haven't showered eaither.
Excuse me, but I showered this morrning.
I'm kind of psychic and I can tell.
When was the last time time you took a shower?
Okay, but you should go shower now.
I thought you didn't like liars.
Don't ask me about my hygiene, that's just awkward.
Why, I didn't sweat at all today?
I don't believe that.
Why, cause you haven't showered in ages? Why?
No, I shower more than you probably.
Big lie.
I feel like you got offended and now you're going thorugh your candy stash to try to cover up your sadness. I didn I didn't lie. I bet you're laughing at my text now.
Stacker. Are you watching me through the window?
I don't understand what you meant by that. No.... I think the word you were looking for is stalker.
Cause there is definitely a shadowy figure out there.
You said stacker.
I know what I said. And you know wht I meant.
I don't think you are supposed to make so many mistakes in your typing. I need to go now. I have things to do. That may or may not include showering.
You know what Kyle was the guy who won last time and he had the worst typing ever. It was worse than me.
Oh, how did he win then? Is this the second round? How do you know he won? I told you I have to go.
Yeah the last session I think ended on Nov. 2.
When does this session end?
Cause I am psychic.
Nov. 2nd was like 3 days a go.
I have no idea in the galaxy. Yep.
Why do you think that you are psychic?
You got that right.
You obviously aren't. You are not making any sense. Why did you have to bring in the galaxy into this.
I think I am psychic because I knew that Kyle was winning even though it didn't show his name.
I doesn't deserve to be treated that way. Ummm
Uhh. What.
I don't think that's how it works. I meant it.
That's how what works?
Use your common sense and context clues. Exactly.
I thought you had to leave.
Rubber ducky, you're the one. You make bath time so much fun! I do. Can I go now?
What?
Bye.
Yeah go.
Hey, I'm back.
You are a psychic stacker.
What did you have for dinner?
Good stuff what about you?
I had such tasty food too. I had chicken alfredo without the chicken. I also had some broccoli in my chicken alfredo. Then I had some spicy eggplant. A Japanese dish. It was so good. I had like ten servings of it. The spicy egplant was the best. I love spicy things. What about you?
I love spicy things too. Jalapenios flavored things are so good.
I love jalapenos too. I love Japanese food. What kind of food do you like.
I love shushi or suushi. It is so good. I accidentally spelled sushi wrong in my username so now everyone knows me as sushi beast.
Wow that's crazy. I can't believe you spelled it wrong.
Me neither.
It is literally one of the easiest words to spell in the english language. French class is so boring. It is like the worst. I odn't get half of the stuff the teacher says, so I just wing it. For homework we get like eight pages of vocabulary to do and we don't really k now how to do it. Buy I have to leave.
Ok see you soon. I hope french gets more interesting.

Traveling, for sure.
Nice Where would you travel to?
Everywhere! I would want to visit europe the most! What about you
That would be such a cool place to go To travel I would love to go to India or Nepal or some place like that Maybe China
Yeah! That would be awesome!!! I was born in China:) I was too young to remember any of it though India would be pretty neat
That is way awesome! Does you family do any of the traditions or cultures from there?
Not really, I'm adopted. But my parents learned a lot while going to China to get me
Nice
Yeah! I would like to visit again too
Do you think you will ever go back and visit oh you just said that
So what are your hobbies Haha yeah I would like to visit china again
I really like being outside in general
im not sure when but sometime haha That's cool! outdoors is nice and relaxing
I like hiking, taking pictures on those hikes, playing frisbee, water sports
That sounds super fun! I love hiking!
What has been your most favorite hike?
Hmmmm...that's a hard one. I like hikes in the woods mostly. what about you?
I love wooded hikes I really enjoyed summitting mount eddy
Yeah they're nice. That's cool!
It ended up being like a 15 mile hike I was so tired when I finished
wow!!! that's long haha! the longest i have ever done was 13 miles i bet!! haha hikes are killer sometimes
Oh yeah When I was done I ate two foot longs from subway I was so hungry I guess I burned too many calories
WOW!!! haha two?! that's crazy! yeah I bet
I know a guy that does 100 mile races and from start to finish those guys lose weight its crazy
Oh my heavens!! 100 miles?! I could never haha. I wouldn't make it that is super crazy it takes a special kind of person to do that and to even want to do that
Haha exactly cut off two zeros and I can manage that
So what's your favorite foods
I love italian food and sushi but really any food I love trying all sorts of new food
I LOVE SUSHI Me too!! food is sooo goood haha what is a food you absolutely hate
Cow stomach And cilantro
oh really? I looove cilantro. But ew! cow stomach that's nasty
Cilantro tastes like soap to me, its just an extra receptor I have for taste Ill gag if I eat it
Soap??? I think I have heard that before!! haha
Its pretty nasty
wow!! I love cilantro in mexican food Yeah soap isn't good lol
It kinda puts a damper on mexican food and oriental foods
Awww bummer
I have to pick out the cilantro if I can

Hello?
Hi again
Hey Whats up?
Nothing new. What about you?
My computer just flipped out so I needed to restart it I feel bad, I was chatting with someone and had to close it all out
ok that's sad hahaha
I tried to open up ebay to compare prices of things that I am selling and I dont know what I clicked wrong but it started yelling at me saying my computrer was being attacked
Hahaha I hate when that happens. So sad.
Im doing all the scans now to see if it did anything to the computer I hate those and I am not fond of the people who create those things
Me neither. I think you should be fine. Unless you downloaded and installed something.
I didnt Ugh Oh well So anything new with you?
Not really. I I went to a high school play last night
What play was it?
The twelfth night from Shakespeare
Hm, never heard of it
And then I realized that the movie she is the man is inspired on that story Have you seen she is the man?
I havent What is it all about?
The premise of both is that there are a couple of twin siblings, and the girl pretend to be her brother, she falls in love with a guy that loves another girl. At the end her brother comes back and the other girl falls in love with him because she was in love with his sister and everyone ends well in a couple.
That sounds like a roller coaster
Yep, just like all Shakespeare
Haha I guess that is true
Yep
I have never really liked his work though I guess reading the old english was a struggle
Yeah. It's kind of boring.
What is your favorite book you have read?
I really like the Sherlock Holmes collection But now I enjoy reading self development books
Oh thats cool Are they helpful?
Right now I'm reading Artemis Fowl which is fiction, but the last one I read was Smarter, Faster, and Better which is a book that talks about productivity strategies. The one I like the most is rehearsing in your mind.
What is rehearsing in your mind?
let's say that you have to give a presentation or a speech, you practice in your mind you imagine yourself delivering the speech to someone that's a good way to practice, learn, and memorize.
Hm thats interesting
Yes, he also talks about ways to motivate yourself to do things you don't want to do.
I could definitely use that Sometimes I get really effective bursts of things done And other times I take naps
He gives the example on how he had to read a lot of research papers to write the book, And so at the top of all the papers he would write the reason why he was reading it what he wanted to get from it.
That is a good idea! Even for smaller things You could broaden that to stating a purpose for why you do anything
He also talks about setting goals. But in a way that you do more than being busy.
What are some of your big goals in life?
You should read it.
What was the name again?
I want to finish college, get a good job and help my family. Smarter, Faster, Better by Charles Duhigg
Thats right! Ill write it down Those are some great goals
He also wrote another good book called The Power of Habit
Do you recommend that one as well?
Yes, that one talks about how habits are created
At a glance I thought you said hobbits And I was really confused
what trigger them, and how we can change bad habits
Oh cool I will have to try those out
Yeah What is your favorite?
I think habits are fascinating how they can be helpful or hurtful My favorite book?
Yes.
So I havent done a lot of recent reading Besides textbooks if you count those But my favorite series growing up was the Gaurdian of Gahool series
I never heard of those.
They are about owls I really liked, and still do, owls
really, that's interesting What is so fascinating about owls? I don't know a lot about it.
There are just so many kinds, the diversity is intriguing. They are also predators, and their talons are super cool Their wings and silent flight is incredible, their night sight, and hearing is awesome Some scientists were trying to mimic the feather structure to make jets more quiet
Wow, you know a lot. That's cool.
Haha I geeked out a little I am sorry
That's okay I like when people talk about things they are passionate about.
It just is always so genuine I love it to
Yeah What other passions do you have?
Thats like asking me to open pandoras box basically I love light, like so much. With photography I always have an eye out for interesting light I will stop randomly just to appreciate a shadow or a beam of light
That's interesting, I like it I love light, but mainly natural light. So I love looking at the stars and sun, and moon although looking at the sun it's not as fun
bahahahaha I just died oh my gosh No looking at the sun isnt the best, unless you have the cool glasses that let you look at it Or looking at pictures of the sun
Or you can use x-ray sheets I've done that
Oh thats cool what did you use those for?
To see a solar eclipse many years ago
Oh ncie I think the shadows are so cool during an eclipse
yes, they have the shape of the eclipse
THAT IS SO COOL
yeah It's so cool I love it. it's kind of mysterious as well
Can you imagine not understanding what was happening and then living through that I can see why people in the past were so crazy
And that's was basically their calendar as well
I am glad we learned what they were I would straight panic Its amazing they figured so much out with what they ahd had*
Well, they had more time to spare, less distractions and all of that
This is true But I am grateful for phones and computers
Me too
What is something you are most grateful for from modern technology
I really enjoy What'sApp because that's what I use to talk to my family.
Oh that is so sweet My answer seems so selfish now
you can say it. no judgements
toilets....
Hahaha I love that bathroomstoilets are my favorite place to think
I just always appreciate them EXACTLY!
Or to browse instagram haha
Also valid
See all the distractions in our days I use to think there, now I use instagram
I am trying to not take my phone into the bathroom because then I spend too much time And my legs fall asleep
Same here sometimes I have my elbows printed on my knees
Oh that is me every time
Haha Among other things like roommates knocking on the door.
I dont think I have ever been in the bathroom that long luckily we had two bathrooms so usually they could use the other
we had two but I take my time
Hahaha
sometimes on campus the bathroom lights go off.
That is funny
yep
When I was little we were at the hosipital and I went into one of those restrooms with automatic swtiches And the lights went out. and I was still terrified of the dark It felt like I was in there for hours too scared to move
oh, I'm sorry
It was probably like 5 minutes Haha no worries Its hilarious to think about
It is. If it makes you happy, the lights go off on me a least once a week in the Talmage
Hahahaha
Then I wave my arms and they turn on again
that is so funny
I'm not scared, but hey I know how annoying it is There is a bathroom where the light goes all poltergaist before turning off
Oh what does that even mean
You know in scary movies when the lights start blinking? for no reason
OH yes I get it now That would scare me
I think there was a movie with that name. It was a scary movie, I just use the name because my sisters would know that is horror and if I say that the light is doing that they understand
Oh that make sense
They watch a lot of those movies in my house
I am not a fan of scary movies
I used to be when I was growing up, they had a plot to it. Usually around halloween and traditions now they are mainly tortuer torture not fun
Why arnt they fun now?4
It doesn't have a story or tradition It's usually a psycho torturing people
Ah that makes sense I dont like the stories
or people getting involved with witch craft I don't like that What kind of movies you like?
Yeah its not good content
Nothing is lately And that's a bummer
I like the marvel stuff!
Me too who is your favorite? I'll be back in a minute, dinner is calling my name
Okay! But when you get back I really like dr strange
Me too The beginning looks like they were high but it's good
Of the doctor strange movie? I dont quite remember it It has been a while I should watch it again
I love how Marvel managed to bring sherlock and dr. Watson Yeah When the lady in yellow is fighting the bad guys
Oh yeah That part was trippy I remember now
But it was cool
It was really cool It was like the inception stuff
Yes all that street folding shifting stuff and people not noticing I wonder if the same animators worked on both things
Maybe! Can you imagine if it were real? Well even animating that must have been a huge process
Yes that's crazy
I think his powers are so cool And his struggle to get there and how it humbles him so much
Yes He had to become humble even though he is not humble at all
Haha yeah Im excited for them to make the next one with just him
That's going to be so fun I hope they bring the CIA guy from black panther in a cross over since they are together all the time in sherlock
That would be so great! you should go suggest that!
They should have a website for suggestions haha but that could get messy especially after the last movie
Haha can you imagine the amount of suggestions they would get
Or complaints people going crazy I gotta go I'll be back later

Hello!
hello good morning!
lol what happened with the other one?
ahh man i have a bugged chat... another one of these.. sorry im going to reset

What a coincedence!
Spider-man
The ability to spider-man?
No. Just Spider-man Haha
Hehe
Probably flight
I would have the power of omnipotence. Hehe
Well hey
I would be a shapeshifter.
Can you choose one superhero and pick all of their powers? In that case: Superman
Then I could be a squishy
Squishy?
Just kidding
What for real?
I'd shape shift into a dinosaur
So for real shape shifting?
Or a bird so I could fpy fly*
What kind if dinosaur?
Yeah shapeshifting is cool. Probably an Allosaurus Since they're cool.
Can you get the powers of someone you shape shift into?
I don't know but I'd just say yes for omnipotence hehe I could shape shift into a diploma
Haha. I need to eat my fries first.
I could shape shift into an ant I could shape shift into fries
What if you got eaten?
I would shape shift into something else before then and escape.
Oh true
I think I would be allowed to shift into mythical things as well.
Oh cool. What about modern art?
Time travel would be another cool super power as long as you don't mess things up. I could but why would I?
Why not? Odo from Star Trek does.
Why did he do that?
A shapeshifter's purpose in life, on the show, is to become a thing in order to truly understand a thing.
Hold up, why does Yzma have vials for transforming into different animals anyway?
You can't know what a mountain is until you become one
Uh ok
Why not?
Maybe she turns enemies into animals if she doesn't want to kill them?
That makes sense.
But they are still able to talk...
Oh yeah. I have no idea
It's just a plot mcguffin I guess.
A what now?
An object in a story that is there simply to drive the plot forward. Like the one ring or the holy grail. Or the lab building in Ant Man 2 haha.
Wouldn't anything be a plot mcguffin? Is that the actual name for it. Oh true
Yeah that's the actual name for it. Well characters aren't usually mcguffins unless they're Matt Damon and need to be rescued all the time as the main point of the plot.
I see, haha
Some people say that lightsabers are mcguffins but that doesn't really make sense. The Death Star plans woulf be one though. would* The safe in Ant Man 1 in the beginning could be one too
I always put the asterisk before the word I misspelled.
Or the suit I just put it next to the word. I don't really pay attention to where I put it.
Tsk tsk tsk Do you like noodles?
Don't tsk at me! Yeah, I like asian noodles but not pasta so much. Unless it's mac and cheese
Oh good, me too. Lemme tell you something. I like noodles
I like the chow mein from Panda Express a lot. What is your favorite noodle?
Same. Sometimes it's a bit too dry, though. I like all noodles Ramen noodles
Even zuchini noodles?
Soup noodles Those are not noodles
That's what I think. Veggie noodles are lies. Skim milk is water lying about being milk.
It's true. It's like a vegan hot dog or almond milk. Whole milk is the best
Almond milk is easier to say than almond puree with added ingredients. Whole milk is the best.
Nope Do you like ramen?
It depends what kind. Usually not really unless I have no time.
Even the cheese flavored kind?
I actually like what dry ramen tastes like. No, not really.
Oh, you're one of those people
What do you mean "one of those people"?
Only strange people like dry ramen. That's like eating Ritz crackers. Gross.
It's okay to be different! Ritz crackers are delicious!
Of course you can be different, but it's just strange.
Especially Ritz sour cream and onion chips from the vending machines.
Blech!
Maybe you're strange for liking noodles so much. Have you had the noodle dream?!
Actually no. But I do dream of sushi. Just like that guy on the Netflix documentary.
What documentary?
"Jiro Dreams of Sushi" I mean, who wouldn't dream of sushi?
I must say I haven't seen it.
I've only seen part of it. But I do understand him
I hardly ever have food dreams.
I'm sorry. Those are the best dreams
I don't usually remember my dreams.
Interesting
I usually have to wake up during the dream to remember it. Actually last night I think I also had a sushi dream
That's so beautiful. How was it?
It was cool. It was kind of like a build-your-own setup.
That's extra beautiful. Have you ever played Sushi Go?
You walked around to different stations and got your rice and put what kinds of meat and stuff you wanted on it. I think wagyu was an option.
Oh my goodness. Wow. Oh man. I have no words
Yeah, it's a fun game! It's like this game called Go Nuts For Donuts.
Only better since it's sushi
Yes, that's true. I don't really like donuts to be honest. It's also a less frustrating game from my experience.
Really? Me too. They're too sweet. And often really dru
The art in both is really cute though.
*dry Oh good. That really makes a difference
Yeah I don't like how dry they are and they're usually pretty bland.
Yeah. Like, if they were covered in nice apple pie filling, then sure
But then I'd just get a pie instead.
But the crust is dry too
Fruit is tasty. I don't eat the dry crust edge. Only the tasty soft part. You have to get the right pie.
Oh, well, in that case. I don't mind the soft crust under the filling, though. And you know it
Cherry, apple, and blackberry are my favorite. What's your favorite type of pie?
I don't think I've ever had blackberry pie. I like cherry and apple, too. Have you ever had watermelon pie?
Or maybe I mean't blueberry...
You probably meant blueberry. That would be good.
Mmmm Ew, no
Me neither. I did work at a food shelter place that gave away watermelon juice. Not bad.
There's this restaurant that roasts watermelon like meat.
The thing is, it might look like meat, but there's no way that could taste good. Just like vegan hot dogs.
I heard it tastes completely different and that the dude who makes it wasn't trying to make imitation meat or anything.
Weird. I wonder if you could just make it at home
Vegan goldfish crackers are tastey though.
Never had those. I like tofu
I don't think it would taste good. Tofu is rubbery and tasteless. I want tp try wagyu beef. to*
No no no no. Okay true But not in delicious soups or marinades
That's right.
That's right
Never had tofu in a soup. I'm getting sleepy.
Are you serious? Hot and sour soup is the best!
Yes, for both.
I see. Well, I guess we can chat tomorrow then
Okay.
Okay. Bye.
See you later.
Alligator

Hi! How are you? Are you a fan of peanut butter?
hello! yessss i love peanut butter yourself?
I love the taste of peanuts but I'm not a fan of the consistency of peanut butter, it's way too thick or something Which is too bad because I really like the taste of peanut butter!
oh hmmm that's interesting i wonder if u could make some type of thinner peanut butter at home

Happiness and how to feel better about yourself Idk something really uplifting and fun
I think I would give a TED talk that was about how we can be motivated by positive outward expressions verbally
That sounds like a cool topic!!!! I'd definitely watch haha
haha thanks! I said that because lately I have had a lot of friends and family be really negative for some reason. I mean their lives have been kind of sucky but for me it helps me tremendously when I positively talk about situations outwordly
That's good. I love positive vibes, it really does help one's outlook on life
yeah totally and I think that is why god gave us agency because when life gets hard we can do two things. be negative or postive on the situation that we are in
Oh definitely!!! It's all in the grand plan
whats the craziest thing youve ever done?
I jumped off my roof one time
and? did you break stuff? because breaking stuff is cool you still there?
Yeah Im still here!! I'm so sorry!! It's my computers fault Like did I break a bone??? I didn't break a bone that time but I broke my arm from falling off a slide when I was like 8 lol
oooh ouch
yeah, it was literally like 5 feet off the ground but somehow I managed to break it in 2 places it's kind of funny
oh my goodnesss... hahaha sorry im laughing
It's okay. I laugh about it all the time If you can picture it, I was with 3 of my friends and we all wanted to climb up this long slide so we were in this long line to go up and I was at the bottom my friends weren't moving up at all so I was just kind of stuck and then suddenly I slipped and the next thing i knew, I had abroken arm I went the entire day in pain and my parents didn't believe that I had a broken arm even tho it was bright red and swollen to twice its size but I hope that was a funny story for you haha
hahaha yeah it was. I have weak bones apparently but I dont think I do
Oh yeah?? Have you broken any bones??
yeah elbow, pinky toe, wrist, and left ankle
Hooo boy, thats a lot
yeah I have good stories for all of them
Ooh let's hear a few
you choose
Ohhh, I have the power hahaha okay, I'll choose the broken ankle
ok so did I tell you that I like to climb? well I was with my friend in St. George because we love to go down the the desert to go rock climbing because its warm in the winter I was up about 125 feet from the ground and I was placing safety gear and the rock that I was holding broke off and I fell to a ledge about 20 feet down and broke my ankle. My friend had to lower me down 125 feet and I had to crawl on 3s to the car whcih was about a mile away
Omigoodness that's awfull!!!
yeah
It's a pretty good story tho better then my falling off a slide story lol
and the stupid funny part is that we drove back 4 hours to provo that day and i didn't go to the doctor for a week and a half because i didn't think i broke it. Or at least i hoped I didnt because of medical bills but the swelling didn't go down and it got more purple so my friends who I was living with forced me to go see a doctor. Well you know that bone that sticks out onthe ankle? that was just snapped off clean
ewiie thats pretty aweful man how long did it take to heal
the entire winter sememster I crutched around in snow and ice. that was a fun experience. that best part is is that that semester I had classes on the south end of the campus and north so it took me a while to go between classes but my triceps got pretty toned hahaha
Oh that sounds awful Did your cast ever get really wet from the snow???
I actually tol dthem not to give me one because I didn't want to pay 500 more dollars
Omigoodness that's super metal
hahaha I just went to a thrift store and bought a 5 dollar medical boot my ankle is good as new. didnt need a cast
woww smart haha although I'm not sure I'd do that
well you know what you should let the doctors and nurses do their thing. OHHHHHH I forogot to mention I had surgery on my ankles from that break. I had two medical screws that were 4 inches long to put the bones back together
Accck I can't even imagine that sounds horrible I've never had to have surgery I guess I'm just super lucky
eating dinner brb!

I know a lot of 3 year old girls who would be extremely excited
Same! Have you seen Despicable Me 3? There is a scene in that where, oh what's her name the youngest one, and she goes into a forest to see a real unicorn
I haven't! Only the first 2. But Agnes is one of my favorites!
Yes Agnes! That's her name. The third movie wasn't as good as the first ones but it was still enjoyable to watch.

I don't even know what that means
wait are you serious
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha im kidding
wait what
issa joke
how did we get paired
I heard the more you type, the more points you get
wait what
The person with the most points gets a free ipad
I'm literally so confused what am I doing right now
lol we are classic teenagers
I should be in bed did you know they record all of these messages we are so weird I want out
why
but actually I want an ipad
meee too
so imma keep typing
Lol rolf
it stopped telling me when you are typing
rofl
I wish I could send you gifs
WOAHHHHH Ok wait yeah same
I think you're really cool I like you a lot maybe we should hang out or something
If you could relive a day what day would you relive ITS A MONDAY
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA I LOVE THAT VIDEO
I don't even know what day I would relive
relive and change the day or relive because it was a good day and you want to experience it again
Either Oh no my computer is going to die.
no its not
ur rit
you just plugged it in
I luv ya
ahh I don't like dwelling on the past so I hate that question em
Did Meg just day lil pump is older than her by a day
that's what I heard

Hello
hi what day would you relive?
Oh man! That's a tough question haha
it definitely is
I'd say a day from a family trip this last summer. We spent a day in Mexico and it was so fun. I had never been before what about you?
fun! this may sound pretentious, but i've started meditating recently and i think it's best to not focus on the past do you know what i mean? like it's more important to embrace right now and just be happy rather than wishing for a day in the past maybe i wish that question was "what's your favorite memory" instead
Haha. No that makes sense. I'd agree with that too. I love to remember stuff like that, but if your reminiscing turns into wishing you could go back in time... that's bad
exactly, i agree
cause then you stop moving forward. My mom has a funny little sign that says "stop looking backwards. You're not going that way"
true something important i learned is that depression comes from focusing on the past, and anxiety comes from focusing on the future
That makes perfect sense!
yeah! i love thinking about these things haha
Very philosophical haha I find that looking both forward and back is good in moderation
do you like philosophy?
In moderation hahaha I enjoy talking about it to a degree, but I don't spend much time thinking about it lol
Yeah philosophy can definitely end up just thinking yourself in circles are you more of an engineering applied science guy?
Haha too true sort of.. I'm a wired hodgepodge... I am a very technical person, I study computer science. But at the same time I have a very artistic side. I also have an animation emphasis what about you
i'm a computer science major too! i also wanted to do the animation emphasis, but i just decided on the bioinformatics emphasis actually
oh nice!! That stuff is super interesting. No way I could pull it off though ahah kudos
well i'm just barely getting started, we'll see how things go haha have you done a lot of animation yourself?
yah!! It's pretty fun! VERY time consuming my focus is visual effects
that's awesome so do you use after effects and such?
Actually, not a ton. The name after effects is a bit deceiving. Technically speaking after effects is a compositing software. Basically that's a fancy way of saying that it's purpose is to put the different layers of stuff together at the end We use houdini FX and maya mostly
interesting
Houdini's strong point is physical simulations of real world things.. Like water and fire
sweet. have you ever seen those satisfying water simulations on reddit and such?

That would be a little wierd I'm not sure
HEY no they cant because they lack the ability to procreate and that I think is a part of what love is made out of
oh yeah that makes sense so are you number 1 then???
no im number 0:)
No way... you are???
yeah surprise!
No way.. I knew it LOL!!! That's quite incredible
LOL
I can't even wrap my head around that many points
yeah people pick up that I am somewehre up there because I am on all the time
I'm working as hard as I can and I have minimal points lol
lol you had a late start I started when they opened this round
Yeah I did I started 2 days ago and I am really sad because I probably won't have a chance now: but i still really want to try hard!!!
yeah do it! You can still win an IPDA Ipad
I'm hoping so, but I'm not sure I'll work really hard But I'm glad that you will probably get the macbook
thank you Morghan you are so kind and encouraging there was this guy on here that was very salty and hostile towards me because he found out that I was number 0
Aww. That's so rude I'm sorry.
ahh its alright
Do you remember his name??? Did he refuse to talk to you after that?
the competition probably got the best of him
aw that stinks.
well kind of. He was really getting at me so I was ended the chat and I told him that regardless he should enjoy the competition and be nice
Maybe he's trying super hard as well, poor guy
I try to avoid him now that is why I don't start the conversation at the beginning usually because it its him he doesnt talk back to me
That's good stay clear of the negativity So if you don't mind me asking, how many chats do you usually have open??
I try to have about 4 to 6 open
Oh yeah me too anything more gets a little hectic
I used to have 8 but I cant keep up anymore and I found that its better to type longer and have better conversations with people so its not so boring
Yeah. It makes it a lot easier and fun when you can actually talk to people
yeah it does and the connection make its enjoyable too
I've really enjoyed myself so far. It would be interesting to meet the people I am talking with
they had like a mingle and pizza the other week
oh really??? That's pretty cool!
yeah it was but I met the guy that was mean there. That was before he was mean though
That's unfortunate that he was rude just keep working for it!!
yep I will. I have the time!
I've been pretty set on it when I found out about it. I hope they do contests like this more in the future so I have the opportunity to win more stuff. and this is just fun!!
they will do more when Fall semester starts. I don't know what the prizes will be but it will probably still be good hahahaha
Oh i hope so. I'll work super hard so I can maybe get something someday Well, I keep thinking about that box of chocolates I'll probably win. I just hope its a good sized box and not some tiny one you know!! I've been working hard for it
the box is pretty big you will get like 50 mint truffles in it and they are so so so good!!
Wooow!!! That makes it all worth it!! Thanks my dude
yeah no worries
Whats the most amount of points you have gotten from a single chat???
uhhhh like 100k but it was a long one
Oh yeah. I had one of those. Those are awesome It gets you a lot of points in one go and it's satisfying to see your score go up so much.
yeah it does I love it haahaha.
So, about metal. Do you have any songs I should listen to?
OH MORGHAN didyou listent to that band i told you about yesterday? you never responded
Oh yeah. The virus on my computer closed the tab. But i listened to it a little bit!! They were pretty good!! I liked one a lot but I can't quite recall the name of it
no worries. I would recommend you listen to August Burns Red or Underoath. These are my all time favorites and they are christian metal band but don't worry they aren't one of those cliche chritian bands.
Christian metal bands aren't that bad. I really like skillet They are pretty good
ooh yeah skillet
Do you have a fav song by them?
its been a really long time since I heard them but theres this one song on their first album thats good

this is going to sound depressing but I would relive a day I spent with my friend before he lost his battle to brain cancer! We went out to a movie then ate ice cream and just did a bunch of our favorite things
that is really sad... but it sounds like it was a lot of fun
yea haha what about you?
I can't decide if I would rather relive a day that was really good or one I wish I could change
sORRY LOL DIDNT MEAN TO MAKE THINGS SAD***
lol its fine
I agree! Thats tough!
I think I would rather relive a happy day
haha good idea such as?
The day I got my dog was pretty exciting
awww what kind of dog do you have?
we trained her as a guide dog then she got retired and came back in an airplane
AWWWW CUTEEEEE
she's a black lab I have to go run an errand for my mom real quick
aw labs are so cute!!
I'll be right back

Hey what's up!
Hey haha I guess there wasn't a lot of chance in that
We meet again:) Yeah no one is on
I have another would you rather Would you rather be beautiful and dumb or ugly and smart?
Ugly and smart, I would get taken advantage of the other way around What about you? Did you say something?
Yeah, I would rather be ugly and smart. With smarts, you can be rich, and nobody's really that ugly, just poor.
Yeah
You can essentially buy beauty, if you want it
Good point I wonder what life would be like if everyone were beautiful People would probably think that everyone else was ugly and that everyone is just all ugly I don't know if I'm making sense
No I see what you mean, because right now so many people that we think look average are actually rather beautiful, but our standards of beauty have risen so much that they're impossible to keep up with
I wonder if our standards of beauty would just change to looking like whoever was popular at the time
I mean, people compare themselves to the most beautiful people in the world and feel ugly, but when compared to just an average person they look fine Yeah I think they do,
What do you think is the coolest car in the entire world
pt cruiser limo stretch pt cruiser

Hey You up?
Hello fellow human! It is me, A real human just like you You know, I think that if computers started asking not to be turned off I would definitely listen to them. Maybe us humans don't understand how bad it is to be turned off! Anyways, lets talk about breathing. I breathe all the time! Hello fellow human are you there? Goodbye

Hello! You here? Helloooo.
Yea Are you there?

This is a dumb question haha. How is you end of the semester going?
Is going great. I have two finals left. What about you?
Me too. trying to study for one now but its not working too well hahaha
Yeah. I understand you What final you have left?
My religion class which I am worried about bc I havnt really studied for that yet. and then my interior design class final. which im making a quizlet for rn and im not super worried about that one You?
I have organizational effectiveness and Computer Science.
did you like those classes
Yes. Organizational effectiveness talked about things that are important in companies and in life, like communication, kinds of leadership, solving conflicts and all of that. The computer science one was super fun. My professor is awesome and the concepts we learned will help in the future. The lab was tedious sometimes, but I'm over it now hahah What is your major?
Oh thats awesome. right now Im undecided. it was my first semester so I dont know yet. Im interested in interior design but they dont have a program for that here: so im fiiguring it out. what is your major?
Computer Science. I think LDS Business College has interior design
kinda guessed that hahaha. Yeah I talked to my professor about the best options so he gave me some. I could go there for it but its only associates so I wouldnt be able to do as much with it
True.
I want to stay at BYU as long as I can so I am exploring some other things to see if I like anything else
What is your other options?
Im thinking maybe landscape management or construction management. Im taking an intro to Landscape management for fall to see if i might like it either that or I might do graphic design but thats a harder program to get into
I thought about doing graphic design, but decided cs instead because it's also a creative major, but with more possibilities. And I love technology.
Thats awesome. Yeah my mom started out graphic design but changed to communications. So theres a good chance I might change my mind about interior design
I know a few people in graphic design, it's a heavy major, you are constantly working to improve your portfolio. They are always drawing or sketching things.
yeah my roomate was in that too. which maybe I wont be into that. Im just thinking of things that would look good for interior design if were to transfer to another school How long have you been at BYU
You can try to take some classes that would be transferable. I've been here for two years, I'm just finishing my sophomore year.
oh okay nice! Yeah its just hard one bc credits always transfer differently with different schools and two, byu only has a few interior design classes
That's hard. I know some people that had problems with that when they tried to transfer to their countries. Other countries don't have general classes, so since your first semester you're doing things for your major. So depending on your major, they don't accept your graduation here because they will have less credits.
ohhhhh man thats hard. It would be nice if we didnt have to take generals. they suck and just get in the way of me exploring what I want to do
Yeah, I don't like most of the generals. I think it's a lot of humanities classes. I wish some of the student development classes were generals. They are so useful. I took Effective Learning from Brother Hammock, he is so nice
that is true they dont require student development classes but it would be more helpful I feel like than some of the generals. Oh ill take a note of that.
I recommend that class. He is fun, and chill. The student development classes are more useful, you can actually learn things that you will apply in life like public speaking.
One thing I love about this chit chat challenge is that ive gotten some really good advice from other students haha its such a win win situation. I think I might add one to my schedule now lol
haha right, I feel like I'm having meaningful conversations here.
I think its cool bc its with people you will never know in real life that will never know you so I feel like I can share anything and be completely real plus I want that mac book so I wanna type as many words as possible
Haha what is your ranking?
I used to be 8 but now im 15 bc i havnt done it in a while but the macbook challenge starts the 30th i think so im okay for now
yeah. And the people up there are typing like crazy, look at those numbers
yeah seriously. I dont think I can get number one for this first round probably not even top 5 it would be hard
And demanding
true
I guess some people have more time.
It was hard this weekend bc I moved out of my appartment and I have finals too
I have to move out next weekend.
are you staying for spring summer?
No, I'm going to Seattle. I have an internship there this summer.
oh fun! is it paid?
Yes. All CS internships are.
very nice. Ill be staying in provo but Im working full time to get money for fall. Im excited to not be in school this summer
Me too. I need a break from homework. Hey I'm heading to bed. I need some sleep before studying more. It was nice talking to you.

Hello! The best thing that happened to me was going to Boston over the summer How about you? I liked Boston We almost stumbled across American history everyday We were able to go to the Boston pops firework show too. It was very American We also went up to Maine and then down to Connecticut for two separate weekends Both were really neat It's amazing how the east coast can be so diverse The lighthouses in Maine were so old and very picturesque against the rocky New England coast line I kind of wish we had lobster out there My wife really isn't into sea food but she said that she would try it out there because it was so fresh it was just so expensive And overall, we had no regrets We also learned a lot about how to deal with a lot of rain. It would pour somedays and we had to figure out how to still get to work, be outside in the rain Have you ever been to Boston? We also did some hikes while we were out there Since my wife and I had been living in Utah for the past couple of years we missed having good mountainy hikes And rocks in general Kind of weird huh? We found some good hike though They definately weren't like any up American Fork Canyon but there were goood At the top they had to build a little stand so you could see up over everything So it wasn;t much of a mountain but it was still good So am I supposed to just talk to myself on this thing? It seems like half of the time I starting chatting and nothing happens That's ok though I kind of want that ipad or macbook But there are several people who have a lot of points already haha oh well I guess I mean how to you almost have 2 million points on day two? Crazy! So question. Do you think it would be fun to be subadiver instructor? *scuba diver I think it would extra fun especially if I lived out in Hawaii or the Caribbean You know?
wow that came quick you must be super dedicated haha how are you typing so quick??? Or Have I been on the chat secretly this whole time I love the strategy...type even if no one is there. You must be one of the top two if I'm right... it takes a ton of time to get to 1.9 million. That's insnae I'm sorry that I missed you! I'll leave this open for tomorrow, if you choose to come back. I think I've already met you on here, to be honest. I remember chatting with a ninja way back probably in the first rounds are you still there??? party machines wwere regularly attacked as corrupt and inefficient, run by party hacks incapalbe of dealing wiht problems created by the gorwth of hte the large industry and natinoal markest. Reformers, working almost entirely from within the two party system, sought to destory the party machines by depriving party leaders of hte capacity to reward followers;.

Hello, anyone here?
Hello. Yes I am here
So what do you think about the prompt? What's your favorite smell?
I don't think I have a favorite smell. There are just too many good and bad smells. I don't think I could choose a favorite smell.

Oh for sure:p
oh my finally a person! I anni how are you doing this morning??? or is it annika?
yeah it's annika:) I'm doing great! How are you??
nice to meet you I am doing great this morning!
yeah you too!
I am actually getting sick of these prompts. I've had them too many times hahahaha but why do you think its murder to turn them off?
ahahahaha I had a couple of the same ones yesterday honestly I don't think I'm passionate enough about the topic to make an informed decision heh Where are you from?
oh hahaha no worries! I am originally from South Korea but I grew up mostly here in Provo What about you Annika?
That is so so cool! I have a really good friend on a mission in South Korea right now:) I'm from Arizona!
hes on the best mission hahhaha
haha I believe it! What type of music do you like to listen to?
I was a HUGE metal head when I was in high school believe it or not but now I really broadened by music taste. I listen to metal along with, rap hiphop, RB, Classics, all kinds
Haha I love it that's so cool! That's so dope
not country though but sometimes I do because my friends like to switch it up haha what about you?
There's not much I don't like listening to! I guess it really just depends on my mood
ahhh you know what?
I'm definitely on board with switching it up what??
I have actually gotten kind of bored with music lately that I would drive around in silence Its actually really meditating because I have like a full brain attention to myself when I drive
yeah I totally feel you! Whenever I get bored of my stuff I like listening to my church playlist
ooooh that is a good one. I probably would do that if I didn't listen to church music for 2 years straight and EFY music 2 years straight hahahaha
hahahaha yeahhh did you serve a mission?
yeah I did! I served in Oakland and San Francisco speaking cambodian what about you?
No way!! I LOVE San Fran 3 I'm an incoming freshman hahah
right? its the best city in the worl world. oh congrats on getting in to BYU!
Thank you! I'm hoping to go on a mission when I'm old enough though for sure
oooh where would you want to go when you got called?
Hmmm I dunno I think a church history mission would be so cool! And I've always wanted to go stateside speaking Spanish
oh wow! I have never heard anyone say that before. You are the first. church history!
hahaha yup it's a strange one!
oh thats interesting why state side?
I dunno, I've just always thought it'd be more of my thing But I guess we'll see!!
I served state side and do you know what we say to peoplel who went to third worl d countries?
haha what?
I would say things like "man those hot showers in the morning were so nice" or "man I loved my toilet" things like that
ahahahaha exactly why stateside sounds so so nice I just don't know if I could handle the culture shock ahah I went to Mexico for 2 12 weeks and it was quite something
hahaha I want to visit mexico. My friend is ther eright now for their anniversary trip
no way! It's goooorgeous
yeah I am super jealous of them but they are in a lot of debt.
And the culture is actually really fun Mexico? yeah it's definitely a very poor country, well most parts anyway
no i mean my friend hahaha hes in a lot of debt and still tries to live the high life you still there my friend?
So sorry! oh hahaha I get you now
no worries. So what kind of human are you? are you a monthly payment i dont care about debt person or I need to save and buy things with cash? my buddy is the debt guy and I think its a risky life style
well I'm still kinda young haha but as of right now I tend to lean on the frugal side
thats good frugal is good especially since college is not cheap
yeahhh nothing in life is cheap it's starting to hit me hard now
yeah once you come out here it will really hit you adulting is hard what do you do to destress? i think ineed new techniques
yeah especially since I won
you won?
yeah especially since I won't have a job right of the bat
oh haha
yeah especially since I won't have a job right off the bat
yeah that ok though. I didn't either but if you want to look on campus jobs arent bad you still there my friend?

hello!
Hey!
personally I like Mozart better hahah how are you?
I'm doing great, I just took my senior photos
ooooo WOO congrats on being accepted to BYU tho! that's exciting!
Thanks I'm really excited.
how were ur pics?
Haha really good I'm the mascot for my school and I got to take some pictures in the suit
WOW THAT IS SO COOOL what's the mascot for your school?
And I took some pictures in the cap and gown IN the suit It's a black and teal hawk
HAHAHA THAT'S GREAT yoo that's a sick sounding mascot my hs's mascot was SO DUMB
Haha what was it?
we were "gold" and brown mustangs
Ew That's actually so gross
but they changed the colors as soon as my class graduated and it's not silver, black, and actual gold yeah our "gold" was like urine yellow it was so bad so our cap and gown was brown for boys and a decent looking yellow for girls last years class was black and silver and they looked sO good
HahaHAHAHA I'm laughing so hard at the cap and gown hahahaha Ours are just black haha
man yeah it was BAD
Haha that's literally the worst
but i'm glad BYU has pretty solid colors so I won't have a repeat of terrible colors for my college grad
Yeah ok I have to take some stuff out of my car but you're not boring so stay put hold on
gotcha!
Yeah isn't byu just black for cap and gowns
blueeee
Aw sick
that yung dark blue sosososos good
That's awesome I love blue
yessss what are you planning to major in?
So if you're not jade then who are you [x files song] Oh haha I'm planning on majoring in physiology and developmental biology
who KNOWS oooooo that sounds TOUGH
Haha yeah i just found out it has the highest failure rate of any byu major so I'll probably switch to public health or something
oh boy yeah what are you planning to do with it after college?
Med school
oooooo wow big dreams
Yeah what about you? What's your major?
sociology focus on criminology and law! pretty good stuff
Thats so cool have you read just mercy by bryan stevenson
i have not... what is it about?
Its about wrongful conviction and a biased court system
on yeS *oh yes
It makes me want to throw the book off a cliff its so frustrating to see peoples lives ruined
i love political commentary YEAH and it doesn't seem like it's getting better either so that sucks
Yeah it shares a lot of cases this guy fought in to change the sentence based on the mental health of his client or if the judge or jury were just straight up racist But it focuses on the wrongful conviction of walter mcmillian who had an alibi that was confirmed by a police officer at a fish cook out for his church
MAN deep stuff I'll put it on my to read list LOL i have so much time this spring to rEAD and just mess around
and the testimony that the entire case rested on was later recinded because the guy was lying the whole time and walter STILL went to prison and was on death row for 6 YEARS I did a research project on it and it s u c k s
YOOO and people like that real life get a record so there goes their entire life too
Yes I know right?? Like even after theyre exonerated they still carry the weight of what people did to them
Exactly it's toTALLY unfair
Yeah What are you planning on doing after you graduate?
well hopefully either our system gets better or like people just stop being jerks i'm looking into law enforcement basically the dream job is to work as an investigator with the FBI but we'll see if that actually happens
Thats so cool well good for you
yup! and sociology is so good for it because I learn a lot about interactions between individuals and their society
Yes absolutely

Hello!
Hey are you there

definitely not
Hi natalie I agree. You cant murder something that is not alive I am going to close out on this and keep talking to you in our other open chat unless you really want to do two separate chats.:-)

Traveling.
hey how's your sunday been so far?? yeah definitely traveling
Lol. Victoria again?
oh my gosh
Hey! Waz up!? Sorry, my phone died... and I haven't charged it yet so.... I 'm sure you've responded by now...
ahh so that's why you haven't answered my dm
Yea... probably
how's your day been?
Pretty good thanks. Yours? How was the singles ward?;)
it was pretty good haha not like i met my future husband or anything though.. we had to have relief society in the gym because there were 75 sisters there today

I got into BYU and I'm graduating hs
I am the similar haha I finished my junior year of college and let me tell yeah It was the hardest
bruh 33 chats are you
hahaha lets get those pointssss am I right?
where are you on the leaderboard
I am up and down near the top 10 you?
20ish what's the prizes again?
the grand prize is a macbook pro, then 2 ipad pros then 2 bose headphones then like 20 chocolates
awesome I might get chocolates or something
maybe me too the mint truffles are super delicious
Never had them but I'm a foodie so it's all good
hahaha what is your favorite food or couisine?
I like tacos!
me too! did you binge on tacos for Cinco de Mayo?
Nah, I'm not mexican haha
oh hahah thats ok. You don't have to be mexican to binge on tacos. I had a party with my friends and non of my friends are mexican haha
Haha it's more of a american holiday
yeah and excuse to eat tacos haha
yeeee
what kind of tacos are your favorite?
Al Pastor
mmmm I love Al Pastor with some grilled pineapples on it

Hello?
The third is a charm hahah
mozart or beethoven?
beethoven
why tho?
mozart had this weird thing with poop
what! Tell me about it this is the first time hearing this haha
There is an article on wikipedia about mozart and scatology Apparently he managed to include these things in some of his songs.
interesting if you could be in a fantasy world what world would you be in? anything. cartoons, video games, books, movies etc
Movies probably, and I would like to be like black widow
really why is that?
She is really good at what she does.
do you remember her back story its really sad
I remember, but we can skip that and just go straight to the part she is awesome.
agreed
What is your favorite character? I'll end this chat

Hi!
heya
How's your day going so far?
good, I haven't quite gotten ready yet haha. What about you?
It's going okay, I just took a calculus exam, so at least that's over with.
Oh for sure. That sounds awful. I had AP calc in high school. It was the worst
Right!? The only thing that's carrying me through is that when I was talking with some other people after, it sounds like I got the alternate version But oh my goodness that class gives me depression
After the test? You got an alternate version of the test that seemed to be better?
Yes, haha, after we all walked out I was talking with some people, but my version seemed to be way harder. But when I took the biology exam yesterday, I also got the alternate version and it was way easier, so I guess my luck balances out.:)
Oh. Sometimes I don't think it's fair that they give alternate versions. Because even though concepts of questions might be the same, you still might get a different score from one to another
Exactly! The thing that made my calculus one so difficult was that the way that the questionsinformation was presented was completely foreign to me, even though I studied But on the bright side, it's over. I'll send a strongly worded letter to college board someday and attach screenshots of this chat as proof.:)
Yeah for sure. In my high school class I still somehow made an A though. I honestly have no idea how. I guess in high school my teacher let us redo problems to get points back from what I can remember
My chemistry teacher did something like that for tests as well, which is nice because then your gradesgpa become the result of accumulating work, not just one test So what year in college are you?
Chemistry teacher in high school? Was that a tougher subject? I've finished my second year So I guess I'm a junior What about you?
I'm a senior in high school [and that chemistry class was just sophomore year, so it wasn't AP, I would die immediately in an AP chem class!]
Ah very nice. So you're still in school for a couple more weeks is that right? Or are you pretty much done at this point?
Well this is the second week of AP exams, then we have one last week of actual school before finals, so we get out on June 1. But because I'm in mostly AP courses, I get exempt from the spring finals so my classes have parties planned for the exam periods
Oh that's a nice perk. So where do you live? I guess you're in one of those areas that has school that goes until June. I think here the high schools get out like may 22 ish
I'm from Dallas, but this is the first school year in a long time that summer starts before the first week of June. My younger siblings are bitter because summer gets cut since the school year starts in the first half of august now How about you?
Oh dang. Yeah we've always had summer start in the first half of August as well. It's kinda nice now college starts a few weeks later. And if you don't do springsummer you also get out earlier But we don't get as many breaks at BYU I'm from St. George, southern utah
That's such a pretty area! Some of my cousins live around there and also in American Fork.
I wonder if I might know any of your cousins haha It definitely is. When I'm up north can't help but miss the red rocks
Maybe! I have a lot of relatives up there.
My only real complaint is it is too hot

Omnipotence would be nice
Super intelligence so i could give myself all the other powers i wanted to have Does omnipotence count as a superpower though? That seems more like a state of being
Omniscience was my next pick haha well, superpower just means anything that is above normal power kind of an open definition i mean omnipotence leads to all sorts of logical paradoxes, but the ability to gain any ability is about as close as you can come
True, have you ever read the lorian legacies?
it looks like my messages are having some difficulty sending
Yeah just a bit
i don't think i've ever heard of it. what's it about?
Its the the series that I am Number 4 is in The main character just has that power, he can gain a bunch of powers
testing testing
I got that one
Oh cool, my end just synced I'm thinking I was in an internet dead-zone
Makes sense, there are a bunch around campus
Interesting. I know very little about I am number 4, but I believe I saw a movie with that title some time ago yeah, that does seem to be the case
You should definitely read them, they are really good books
I'm sure I would really like them, but the internet has killed my attention span for books I read a lot, but it's incredibly tangential Wikipedia rabbit-holes pretty much
I love reading I dont have a lot of time though

So much better! My dog could be my most loyal best friend!
oh hahaha you are talking about the prompt
Yes, I mean, I didn't know who I was talking to lol
oh hahaha if dogs could talk I think they would become one of my best friends too are you a dog or cat person?
Definitely a dog person! What about you?
dog hands down

I would provide free health care.
What's your plan of action? I'd probably sign up!

I would binge watch just about about every tv show
After high confusion and probably a mental breakdown, since that would be wild, I would definitely drive over to Banzai Bowls and make a sick acai bowl for free
Goals
Banzai is such a good time no joke
Truth I changed my mind I would definitely just raid like cafe rio and stuff
I don't know though this would be pretty wild because there's no way you could know for sure if absolutely everyone is gone Haha good choice
That's true
You could turn on TV but nothing would be up because no one is operating it, along with radio stations So you're just kinda sitting there clueless
Ooh yeah dang that's rough
Factual
I'd probably just wallow in self despair
And raid every good food place for comfort Hit the beach for a while
Yeah it'd be lit or just really sad haha
Have a meditation surf mesh to try and keep my sanity Yeah haha I don't know how long I'd want to last because people are pretty cool I like having them around
Gather all the dogs and make a puppy fest
OHHHH There's a reason to live right there
You wouldn't have to share the dogs!! You'd have to find food for them but still
It wouldn't be too hard, just hit the local petco and get all of the dog food That would be a swell time for sure

well i think they can be compatable in a digital way yes "falling in love" is working with someone and loving the way they are so a computer would "love"work wellconnect with a computer
What? No I think that you need endorphins to love... computers are simply too logistical. I don't think working wellLove.
But it depennds how you define love
But I guess with developing tech it could be possible eventually maybe?
the definiton of words changes all the time
How do you define love?
i dont think they could recreate "love in the human definition", but you create a new kind
Interesting take.
Well it depends what im taking about, for this i defin love as a compatidility between two things, workin well together. what do you think??
Ah see I don't think compatibility is necessarily love. It's its own word. It's being compatible.
True but the word care and love are similer. affection- means feelings of fondness and love is feelings of affection.
I think the fundamental problem is that computers don't have feelings.

Hello? Anyone here?
Hey there! Just going along with the prompt, the most interesting thing I have recently learned is that your kidney apparently has a pelvis. I don't quite understand, but my roommate told me about this today. haha

Hey!
My favorite smell is...hmm cookies? oh! or maybe steak
Meat on the grill will send me running any day.
holy
I love barbecues with a burning passion
yeah that sounds great do you have any funny stories? I watched an older guy roll a riding lawn mower once. He was on a hill and he just kinda tipped over. We tried to help him but he seemed a little grouchy.
That sounds like an SNL skit haha!
Yeah like it was a little sad because he had a little trouble getting up but still, golden.
Well there was that time I sliced my hand open in the first week of high school while we were doing a mud brick project and that's why you don't listen to cute sophomores, pal
Oh yikes.
He told me to carve using scissors and we were being timed so I was stressed and cut my hands with dull safety scissors. He stuck one of the bricks under my bleeding hand and was like "blood sacrifice!" so he wasn't that cute anymore. At least everyone knew my name then!
Dang that sounds like a bad day. One time my parents moved while I was at a camp and forgot which day I was getting back. So when I got home there was nothing there. So I had to go to a neighbors house to use a phone, and it took them 5 hours to come and get me.
Wow that seems way worseironically funny! Do you ever think about your life as like a sitcom, so it's funny to all the viewers at home but not for you? Sometimes I think way too hard about the Truman Show!
So i decided to take a shower, but the power started turning on and off, so I ran out of the shower and sat on the floor in a towel for the rest of the time. it freaked me out and yes i totally do! Sometimes I do that "Jim" look from the office into space
That's the most relatable thing I've read today! I hate getting interrupted while I'm getting ready, so that shower issue sounds not fun.: [Your life would be a great Netflix original!
Well I was younger so I thought it was ghosts or something. Yeah ha my friends and I could have a series.
I would watch. 5 stars.
Alright so I got a question! What super hero would you be?
You're talking to a marvel nerd, so good question! Probably Scarlet Witch because her powers are so cool. What about you?
hmm venom is pretty sweet...but he isn't really a super hero...
Oh my gosh that trailer was dope and terrifying The way his suit just came over his face at the end and the tongue... I see you, sony.
yeah I am super excited for it! I really hope they do a good job! Have you seen the new avengers?
YES HAVE YOU AND IF SO LET'S DISCUSS please.
yeah I saw it last weekend! I thought it was great! sad but great!
Oh my goodness that was the snap heard round the universe. Everything about that was perfect and awful and great and I love my superheroes so much more for this movie.
Yeah! So why do you think that doctor strange gave up the stone? All part of the plan?
Probably because the original 6 avengers [especially Tony] will be the ones to take out Thanos for good. And in doing so they all are probably going to die because Marvel takes no prisoners when it comes to destroying my favorite characters [Loki! Heimdall! Gamora! HALF OF THEM!]
hmm probably true!
Did you read the terrible thing that one of the Russo brothers shared on twitter today [grab the tissues now]?
No I didn't. What did it say?
They said that Groot's last words to Rocket before he disintegrated were translated from "I am Groot" to mean "Dad." So now I have depression.
oh: [now that is sad!

Hopefully I could go to the moon, because my sister would have to live there since she's allergic!
I feel bad for your siser is she alergic of peanut butter, or peanuts in general?? and by the way, do you know how to change the name on this chat, for some reason my computer put my whole name in here, and I want to change it
She is actually allergic to tree nuts [hazelnuts, pecans, etc] but peanut butter can sometimes make her uncomfortable. I, on the other hand, live for nutella and bagels
well not that I care, I guess everyone here goes to BYU and there are no creeps to stock me on facebook, haha sorry I typing so many workds because I wnat to get more points
Oh no! I'm sorry, I don't know, this is only the 3rd or 4th chat I've done
haha
It's all good, I guess if I ever run into you at that point I may be able to help you out with your account.:)
oh my gosh, I feel so bad for your sister now, I would never be able to not eat pecans and other nuts, has she tried brazill nuts? what about cashews? is she alergic to that?
Yep! Basically she is officially allergic to any kind of nut that isn't a peanut [she also has environmental allergies pretty bad]
fun fact, peanuts are not from the same family of cashews, pecans and etc, peanuts are from the beans, lentils family, isnt that funny
One time we were at a family gathering and someone made some Nutella smores [we didn't know that there was nutella] so she ate like 4 She said that it was delicious and dangerous!
what is an enviromental allergie? I've never heard of that before
Environmental allergies are like seasonal allergies, where around spring and fall when all the pollen and other stuff is in the air, people get all the sniffles and teary eyes
so can she eat Nutella or not really? well, nuttella is basically 95% oil and sugar and the rest cholcolate an hazel haha
I'm from Texas, so a lot of people I know have allergies whenever it's spring. Yeah we discovered that she definitely can NOT eat nutella that day!
wow, is she pretty sick during this time, does she stays at home most of her time? wow, does she have any other kind of allergies?
No, she just has to take stuff like Zyrtec or over the counter medicine otherwise it's like she has a cold with a runny nose Not that I know of!
I used to have allergies of dust, can you believe, everytime I would be cleaning the house or vacuuming I would get pretty sick how old is your sister?
Wow being allergic to dust is a great way to get out of chores! My sister is in high school. How about you? Do you have siblings?
I do I have 2 older sisters, one is 28 and the other one is 39 so we have a big age difference

Ummmm....I don't think so, haha
Nope!

R I P man that's okay
yeah Ik I can always change my name
yeah! or I mean you could just get a butt ton of followers so that's cool

a lil fame spencer
I don't need fame. I just need netflix and pasta
PASTA pls take care of ur health
what does that mean
pasta isn't that healthy my dude
yolo pasta is soooo good. that's what I'm eating rn haha
WELL GG to you bro what kind of pasta though

Hi! Is anyone there? So right now I'm watching a movie. What are you doing?
I'm at bahama bucks with like 14 of my ward
Nice! bahama bucks is the bomb! How was the meeting?
It's was good. I was kinda late though. I went hiking with Adam and got back a little late, but the meeting was good
Haha you guys went hiking this late and when it's this cold? where did you go hiking? Thats good though that it was a good meeting. You remember the movie August Rush? Well that's the one we are watching right now. It's actually a lot different than I remember. And the actor is the actor from the Good Doctor but as a kid. I didn't know that until now haha. So it's getting a little late. I know you are busy. But literally no one has been on here like all day. Maybe we could just chat in the morning again would you be down? I just want to keep increasing the Gap especially this weekend because I'll have less time once I have to go back to classes. So I'm worried that the other guys will catch up. Not likely, but I just want to prevent it as much as possible ya know? So this is actually really funny because the kid just randomly knows how to write music with absolutely no education haha it's totally unrealistic. All things considered though, the music is really good in the movie. Whoever wrote it was very talented. I'm literally just trying to get points right now ahaha.
Sorry I had to drive home
Yeah no worries. We wouldn't want you to text and drive. That's not good.
No that's really bad. Hey so I actually have Sunday morning conference at like 7:30, so I'm gonna go get ready for bed soon!
Yeah totally! So what time can you chat tomorrow?
Sooooooooo I dont really know, maybe in the afternoon!
Okay! We just gotta stay dedicated!
Will do man! Especially because I'm back down to.number. 3
You are? Did the other guy start chatting more? Oh wait I was chatting with someone earlier. I wonder if it was him.
Yeah, but he is only at like 700000 He is barely above me
I bet it was him.
Probably.
He isn't a threat. He told me he watches netflix till 4am
Anyway, I have to go now!
Okay sounds good! Lets do this again tomorrow!
Oh, boy, you're right, that isn't a threat! Ok!

hello
Heyo!

hello! How are you doing this night
Hi there!
Hows it going
I'm doing well, how are you? what do you study? Or who is your modern day hero? Hmm, this would be nice as an app that would give notifications.
Haha yeah, I am well I study industrial design
Ooo, how far are you in the program?
Im just getting started
That's fun. Are you a freshman then?
Yeah How about you?
I'm far along. I have a bachelors in Music and a minor in computer science.
Oh dang
Im applying to grad school in CS soon. Oh, you'll be there before you know it. [Insert smiley face]
Haha thank
So what do you think of your first year?
Its been alright, Its actually just my first semester
Whoa. Are you going home spring and summer?
yeah I need to work and save for next fall
Okay, what kind of job do you do back home?
construction, marketing, and project design
That sounds intense. What is a typical day like? On the job
Get up 6, drive to the job site, work for 8 hours, come home work on designs and marketing, fall alseep at an unreasonable hour and repeat
Wow, that sounds a lot like school. Do you like it?
Yeah, its something to do and its for my dads business
That's nice, so you see him often at work?
Yeah, its nice. I like spending time with my dad
That sounds really nice.:)
Do you have fun plans for the summer?
Hm, just school, and the GRE, and work. I'd really like to go camping in moab or yellowstone if there is time. What are some non-work related things you enjoy doing?
Oh nice, I hear those are beautiful places I like art, photography, hiking, frisbee
Yeah, Ive only been to Moab once, but it was BEAUTIFUL! What kind if art so you enjoy?
Drawing
Okay, what kind of subject material?
Usually portrait
Ah, cool. Have you been hiking [or snowshoeing] much around the area?
Sadly no, I really want to but i havent gotten off campus much And its a little hard to get away when I dont have a car or many friends with cars
Yeah, thats a bummer. One time we borrowed bikes and biked to the trail head of the Y.... but thats a lot of effort for the middle of the semester.
It sounds like it, but was it worth it?
Hm, the Y is not my favorite hike, we hiked up part of Y mountain I think. It also was during the summer so we had a lot more free time. Hmmm Yeah, for how much time we had I think it was worth the memories What's something fun you have done during the semester? The Y mountain hike extends up from the y and hikes up the mountain more. It seemed a little nicer past the y.
Okay I have heard a lot of similar opinions Um for me, I have really enjoyed dancing,. Its been a good outlet
What kind of dancing?
country swing, ballroom
I'd recommend timp [even just 1st or 2nd falls] and stuart falls before the y. Just in case you get to go sometime.:) There are so many good dancing places around here
Sweet! Thank you for the suggestions!
Well, Im super tired. Its been nice chatting with you. Happy 5ish min till the last day of classes, and have a great night! Ima head to bed. Good night!

this is the most boring question
Haha. Yeah, it is. Beethoven. He was cool since he made music while he was deaf.
hey howsit going??
It's going well. How are you?
I just went to Cafe Rio and ate some lunch haha what about you?
Oh haha. How was it. I've just been chatting with people. Haha. Not much.
hahaha thats good. How many chats do you have going?
A few. Do you have a few?
yeah I got 4
Wow. That's great. It's fun to have more than one.
yeah it is hahah
So what are your plans this week. Doing anything fun?
I just had my job interview. I told you about that right?
Yes! And you think it went well, right! Hope you get it.
yeah thanks. thats about it this week haha. I just need to wait and stress until friday
The waiting is the worst!
yeah........
What else is happening this week?
you know to be honest Im just seriously chilling other than work but work has been slow
What is work? Chilling is good.
I work on Campus doing User Experience Design work. We are currently developing a webiste for videos so that teachers can upload and create subtitles and edit them so that it bloks out unwanted content
Wow! That is really cool! I want a job like that. Sounds super interesting
yeah its really fun! i recommend it. Are you in college yet maybe I can direct you to my way if you want.
I am. I want to go into Information Systems so I'm taking the prereqs for that now.
oh I think you have told me about that a while back when we chatted
Yeah. No worries. I'd forget.
hey no worries. arent you waiting to hear back if you got in or something?
I still need to apply, but yeah I'll wait to hear back after the end of June.
oh ok good luck! I have a lot of friends in IS
Thanks!
have you taken IS 110? thats a dumb question. I mean when did you take IS110?
Haha. I took it a year ago.
hahaha did you like Burton?
Yeah, she was a character, but good. Not that I knew her really that well at all. Easy class though.
yeah it is pretty easy. Did you ever go to the TA lab?
I can't remember. Haha. I might have.
hahaha I used to TA for IS110
Really.
yep
That is great! Nice class to TA for, but huge!
yeah actually I got paid 14 bucks and hour and I got to sit in the lab and usually not many people come in at the beginning so I just watched netlflix or youtube until someon someone came in for help
Wow! That is a great pay! I didn't think TA's got paid that much. Why did you stop?
Yeah the pay is amazing. TAs in the business school gets paid bank because the business school gets a TON of funding so they pay their TAs a lot. but you know american heritag gets only paid like 9 bucks starting and they do a lot more work compared to us I stopped because I had bigger and better things as far as the job goes for me. IS110 was not helping me get experience as far as my User Exerperience Design work goes
Annoying for those TA's. Well, I should be a business TA. Right. I understand that.
yeah do it!!!!! hahaha you could be a IS 201 TA they get paid the same. IS110 is full right now and they aren't hiring for a while.
Darn. I did great in that class. But, I do have pretty good jobs with not that, but still pretty good pay.
Being a TA in IS before you apply helps you get in the program becuase you get to work with the professors
Right. I would. I'm a RA now, so I get to work with them too there. I've thought of that, but I didn't TA 201 in time.
oh ok yeah you are in a good spot then
Thanks. Let's hope. Yeah, I thought of that since if there is a face to put with the name that would be good.
yeah totally. What about Information systems interested you?
I like that I can research different things about human interaction with technology. I like how it is so broad and that I can develop, but I don't have to be hard core like CS It's a bit of business [humans] and computers. Yeah. It's fun.
yeah thats true. Well I hope you get in and do some UX stuff! I probably will see you around sometime because the IT program is leading the UX team at BYU and couple people from IS took it
I should come over and take a look. I think UX is very fascinating. They took IT?
yeah IT has a lot of UX classes that IS students can take if they are really passionate about it. We learn about design thinking methods and also we do real UX work for real c
Cool!
companies around the area for them
I'll look into that! Well, I've got to go! Talk to you later!
